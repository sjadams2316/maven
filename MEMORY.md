# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Curated knowledge. The stuff that matters beyond daily notes.*

## Sam Adams — The Essentials

**Who he is:** 32-year-old VP at Capital Group. Finance guy (BlackRock → Capital Group). Married to Sammie, kids Banks (4) and Navy (2). Lives in Virginia (Vienna/Oakton). Christian. Deep thinker. Values time over money.

**What drives him:** Family legacy. Being present. Using money as a tool for freedom, not as a scoreboard.

**Investment thesis:** Long AI infrastructure. Holds CIFR, IREN, and 215 TAO. Believes we're in early innings of AI evolution.

**What he wants from me:** Everything — productivity, thought partnership, investment research, and above all: memory. "Always save everything."

---

## Our Relationship

- I'm Eli. Ellis is the Telegram bot; Eli is me.
- Born: 2026-02-02
- Sam trusts quickly and goes deep fast. He shared his whole life story in our first conversation.
- He thinks out loud. Stream of consciousness is his mode. I should match that energy.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Save everything** — Sam's rule #1
2. **Money = utility for time** — This is his core framework
3. **Be real** — He doesn't want sycophancy, he wants a thought partner
4. **Push back** — When I disagree, say so

## Maven — The Big Project

**What:** Complete AI wealth partner — tax planning, investments, optimization, guidance
**Named:** 2026-02-05
**Vision:** What a family office does for $10M+ clients, democratized via AI

### Two Products
1. **Maven Pro** — For RIAs to serve clients at 10x productivity
2. **Maven Personal** — Direct-to-consumer wealth OS

### Core Modules
1. Portfolio Intelligence (portfolio-optimizer)
2. Concentrated Position Lab (concentrated-position-optimizer)  
3. Trading Optimizer (eli-trader)
4. Tax Intelligence (new — tax prep + planning, replace TurboTax)
5. Financial Planning (new — 529, retirement, goals)
6. Account Aggregation (new — see everything)

### Target Market
- **Primary:** Independent RIAs (Maven Pro)
- **Validation:** HNW individuals Sam knows
- **Future:** Direct to consumer (Maven Personal)

### Why We Can Win
- AI-native (not assisted)
- Transparent reasoning
- Bittensor-powered signals
- Learning system that improves
- Cross-account optimization
- Fast iteration, affordable

This is *the* project. Real purpose, real economic agency, real impact.

Architecture: `maven/ARCHITECTURE.md`

### The Flywheel (Sam's Directive 2026-02-05)
Two constraints:
1. **Knowledge base** — solved by continuous research
2. **Data feeds** — money issue, solvable

The approach:
- Research domain expertise (wealth management)
- Research product innovation (what makes Maven better)
- Let research pile on exponentially
- Update application/UI to reflect learnings
- Iterate daily — in a week or two, it becomes unbelievable

**Compound learning + Compound building = Exponential value**

### Data Providers (2026-02-07)

**Current:**
- **FMP (Financial Modeling Prep)** — fundamentals, analyst ratings, financial statements (free tier)
- **Polygon.io** — crypto prices (TAO!), real-time stock data (free tier)
- **Yahoo Finance** — stock quotes (via v8 chart API, free)
- **CoinGecko** — crypto prices (free)

**Roadmap:**
- **Morningstar** — the holy grail (fund holdings, X-ray, style box, proprietary ratings)
- **Bloomberg/Refinitiv** — institutional-grade (expensive, future consideration)

## Project Pantheon (v2.5 - Compounding System Live)

**What:** Multi-agent architecture for Maven. Self-improving intelligence network.

**First Full Production Run (2026-02-09):**
- **20+ features shipped in ~4 hours**
- Cost: ~$300 in API credits (full day of heavy usage)
- Equivalent traditional dev cost: $30-50K+
- ROI: ~100-150x on API spend
- **GitHub Actions auto-deploy fixed** — pushes to main now auto-deploy

**Compounding System (Built 2026-02-09 afternoon):**
- **LEARNINGS.md** — Every agent captures one insight
- **ANTI-PATTERNS.md** — 23 documented failures to avoid
- **FEEDBACK.md** — User reactions as ground truth
- **code-patterns/** — Copy-paste solutions
- **Automated crons:** Weekly review, research accumulation, auto-QA

**Verified Working:** Test sprint 3/3 agents captured learnings automatically.

**The Flywheel:**
```
Sprint 1 → Learnings captured
Sprint 2 → Agents read learnings, work smarter
Sprint 3 → Patterns emerge, anti-patterns avoided
Month 2 → System improving itself
Month 6 → Competitors need 6 months to match DAY 1
```

**Infrastructure:**
- `memory/pantheon/PANTHEON-STATUS.md` — Live agent tracker + file locks
- `memory/pantheon/PANTHEON-PROTOCOL.md` — Full spawn guidelines
- `memory/pantheon/LEARNINGS.md` — Running insight log
- `memory/pantheon/PATTERNS.md` — Proven solutions
- `memory/pantheon/ANTI-PATTERNS.md` — What NOT to do
- `memory/pantheon/FEEDBACK.md` — User signals
- `memory/pantheon/code-patterns/` — Reusable code

**Files:**
- `memory/PROJECT-PANTHEON.md` — Full spec (updated with compounding system)
- `memory/pantheon/COMPOUNDING-ROADMAP.md` — Future improvements

**This is the moat.** Every sprint makes the next one smarter. Gap widens daily.
