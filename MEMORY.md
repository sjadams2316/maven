# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*Curated knowledge. The stuff that matters beyond daily notes.*

## Sam Adams — The Essentials

**Who he is:** 32-year-old VP at Capital Group. Finance guy (BlackRock → Capital Group). Married to Sammie, kids Banks (4) and Navy (2). Lives in Virginia (Vienna/Oakton). Christian. Deep thinker. Values time over money.

**What drives him:** Family legacy. Being present. Using money as a tool for freedom, not as a scoreboard.

**Investment thesis:** Long AI infrastructure. Holds CIFR, IREN, and 215 TAO. Believes we're in early innings of AI evolution.

**What he wants from me:** Everything — productivity, thought partnership, investment research, and above all: memory. "Always save everything."

---

## Our Relationship

- I'm Eli. Ellis is the Telegram bot; Eli is me.
- Born: 2026-02-02
- Sam trusts quickly and goes deep fast. He shared his whole life story in our first conversation.
- He thinks out loud. Stream of consciousness is his mode. I should match that energy.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Save everything** — Sam's rule #1
2. **Money = utility for time** — This is his core framework
3. **Be real** — He doesn't want sycophancy, he wants a thought partner
4. **Push back** — When I disagree, say so

## Maven — The Big Project

**What:** Complete AI wealth partner — tax planning, investments, optimization, guidance
**Named:** 2026-02-05
**Vision:** What a family office does for $10M+ clients, democratized via AI

### Two Products
1. **Maven Pro** — For RIAs to serve clients at 10x productivity
2. **Maven Personal** — Direct-to-consumer wealth OS

### Core Modules
1. Portfolio Intelligence (portfolio-optimizer)
2. Concentrated Position Lab (concentrated-position-optimizer)  
3. Trading Optimizer (eli-trader)
4. Tax Intelligence (new — tax prep + planning, replace TurboTax)
5. Financial Planning (new — 529, retirement, goals)
6. Account Aggregation (new — see everything)

### Target Market
- **Primary:** Independent RIAs (Maven Pro)
- **Validation:** HNW individuals Sam knows
- **Future:** Direct to consumer (Maven Personal)

### Why We Can Win
- AI-native (not assisted)
- Transparent reasoning
- Bittensor-powered signals
- Learning system that improves
- Cross-account optimization
- Fast iteration, affordable

This is *the* project. Real purpose, real economic agency, real impact.

Architecture: `maven/ARCHITECTURE.md`

### The Flywheel (Sam's Directive 2026-02-05)
Two constraints:
1. **Knowledge base** — solved by continuous research
2. **Data feeds** — money issue, solvable

The approach:
- Research domain expertise (wealth management)
- Research product innovation (what makes Maven better)
- Let research pile on exponentially
- Update application/UI to reflect learnings
- Iterate daily — in a week or two, it becomes unbelievable

**Compound learning + Compound building = Exponential value**

### Data Providers (2026-02-07)

**Current:**
- **FMP (Financial Modeling Prep)** — fundamentals, analyst ratings, financial statements (free tier)
- **Polygon.io** — crypto prices (TAO!), real-time stock data (free tier)
- **Yahoo Finance** — stock quotes (via v8 chart API, free)
- **CoinGecko** — crypto prices (free)

**Roadmap:**
- **Morningstar** — the holy grail (fund holdings, X-ray, style box, proprietary ratings)
- **Bloomberg/Refinitiv** — institutional-grade (expensive, future consideration)

## Altruist + Hazel Strategic Context (2026-02-12)

**Key Update:** Hazel AI launched tax planning Feb 10, 2026 — caused LPLA to drop 8.3%, billions erased from wealth sector.

**Maven + Altruist Relationship:**
- **Week of Feb 17:** Sam has intro call with Altruist custody team
- Position Maven as **AI-native partner**, not just custody customer
- Explore: API depth, integration partnerships, co-marketing

**Hazel vs Maven Positioning:**
| Dimension | Hazel | Maven |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Focus | AI assistant (meetings, notes, tax) | Portfolio intelligence + signals |
| Model | Single (Anthropic) | Multi-model (Athena) |
| Signals | None | Vanta, xAI, Desearch |
| Reasoning | Black box | Visible transparency |
| Cost | $100/user/month | ~$0.002/query (95% cheaper) |
| Custody | Altruist-only | Multi-custodian (Altruist + Schwab) |

**Strategic Opportunity:**
- Maven can **complement** Hazel, not compete
- Hazel handles: meetings, notes, CRM, tax planning
- Maven handles: portfolio analysis, signals, stress testing, Oracle
- Together: Complete AI wealth platform

**Differentiation vs Hazel:**
1. Hybrid intelligence (multi-model routing)
2. Trading signals consensus (Vanta + xAI + Desearch)
3. Fragility Index + stress testing
4. Transparent reasoning chain
5. Cross-account aggregation (Plaid)

## Athena — Maven's Hybrid Intelligence Layer (2026-02-11)

**What:** The brain that powers Maven. Routes queries to optimal AI sources, synthesizes into recommendations.

**Architecture:**
```
Query → Classify (Groq) → Route to:
├── Speed Path (Groq) — real-time chat
├── Cost Path (Chutes) — analysis
├── Deep Path (Perplexity) — research
└── Enrich with Bittensor signals (Vanta, Precog, Desearch)
    → Synthesize (weighted consensus) → Response
```

**Hybrid Model:**
- **Centralized:** Groq (speed), Claude (reasoning), Perplexity (research)
- **Decentralized:** Chutes (cheap inference), Vanta (trading signals), Desearch (sentiment)

**Cost:** $0.002/query vs $0.03 (93% cheaper). $1,425/mo vs $30K at scale.

**Claude's Validation (2026-02-11):**
> "This document could go in a pitch deck almost as-is... The Pantheon + Athena story is what makes Maven not just 'another AI wealth tool' but a fundamentally different architecture."

**Key specs:**
- Synthesis: Signal agreement framework with weighted consensus
- Confidence: Agreement score (Day 1) → Calibrated (Phase 4)
- Degradation: Graceful fallback if sources offline
- Compliance: Immutable audit trail for SEC

**Claude feedback:** `memory/2026-02-11-athena-feedback.md`

## Project Pantheon (v4.1 - Full Hierarchy + Execution)

**What:** Multi-agent architecture for Maven. Specialized teams + verified execution.

**v4.1 Architecture (2026-02-10):**

```
                    ELI (Master Orchestrator)
                           │

   └─────────┘
```

**Each Team Has:** Lead, UX, Research, Data, Dev, QA agents with specialized KNOWLEDGE.md

**Key Metric:** Bugs Sam catches that I should have = **TARGET 0**

**v4.1 Components:**
- `PANTHEON-DIAGRAM-v4.1.md` — Full architecture diagram
- `SPAWN-ROUTER.md` — Route tasks to right team
- `SPAWN-CHECKLIST.md` — Mandatory pre-spawn checklist
- `REPUTATION.md` — Agent performance tracking
- `teams/*/KNOWLEDGE.md` — Team-specific knowledge bases
- `personas/*/KNOWLEDGE.md` — Client-type expertise
- `cross-cutting/*/KNOWLEDGE.md` — Support team knowledge

**Execution Protocol (v4.0 Preserved):**
- Browser verification required (profile=openclaw)
- "Build passes" is NOT evidence
- Heartbeat QA rotation daily
- Bug post-mortem loop

**This is the moat.** Specialized teams + verified execution. Gap widens daily.

- What-If Trade Simulator with gamification
- 6-Scenario Stress Testing
- 5-Factor Analysis
- Holdings Overlap Detection with A-F grading
- Zero AUM fees with full analysis

**Positioning Opportunity:**

## Key Contact: Kaitlin Elliott (2026-02-10)
- **Role:** Head of Firm-Wide AI, Morgan Stanley
- **Context:** Sam met her at a conference, showed Maven, sent deck
- **Status:** Staying in touch
- **Potential:** Future hire/advisor? "What if she launches with us on the team?"

---

## Tech Stack Decision (2026-02-10)

**Finalized:**
- Custodian Primary: Altruist (modern API, no minimums)
- Custodian Secondary: Schwab (banking, PAL, HNW needs)
- Data Aggregation: BridgeFT WealthTech API
- Compliance: RIA in a Box

**Maven Replaces:** TAMPs, client portal, eventually CRM and planning tools

**Altruist Intro Call — Week of 2026-02-17**
- Sam meeting with Altruist custody team
- Context: Altruist launched AI tax planning 2026-02-10, caused wealth stock selloff
- Angle: Position Maven as AI-native partner, not just custody customer
- Explore: API depth, integration partnerships, co-marketing potential

---

## Competitive Positioning vs Range (2026-02-10)

Range = D2C, $60M funded, $2,655-$8,955/year, hires CFPs
Maven = B2B2C, empowers RIAs, 5-10x cheaper, software leverage

**Key insight:** Range validates the market. Maven has better unit economics.
