## Usage

**Before spawning an agent:**
1. Check "Currently Running" — is similar work in flight?
2. Check "File Lock Registry" — will this touch locked files?
3. Add entry to both when spawning

**After agent completes:**
1. Move from "Currently Running" to "Recently Completed"
2. Release file locks
