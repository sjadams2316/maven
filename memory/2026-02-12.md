# 2026-02-12 — Daily Notes

## Morning Session

### OpenClaw Upgrade
- Upgraded to Claude Opus 4.6 — caused brief outage (wasn't responding)
- Sam noticed and restarted

### Market Indices Fix (Completed)
- Sam frustrated that index cards on landing page looked stale and weren't clickable
- **Subagent deployed:** Clickable TradingView chart modals, all 6 indices (S&P, Dow, Nasdaq, RUT, BTC, TAO), market session badges
- Commits: a7bedb9, f40d2cf

### Futures Data Fix (Deployed)
- Sam pointed out pre-market still showing stale index closes instead of live futures
- Built: API now fetches ES=F, NQ=F, YM=F, RTY=F from Yahoo during pre-market/after-hours
- Frontend labels them as "S&P 500 Futures" etc. with previous close reference
- Commit: cfa01bf — awaiting Vercel deploy verification

### Oracle + Athena — Next Priority
- Sam wants Oracle to be THE feature. Extended thinking + memory + Athena multi-LLM routing
- Key points Sam emphasized:
  1. Extended thinking (visible reasoning chain) — the trust mechanism
  2. Memory across sessions — feels like a real advisor relationship
  3. Athena as multiplier — multi-LLM routing (Groq speed, Claude depth, Perplexity research, Bittensor signals)
  4. Vanta + Bittensor subnet integration — Sam wants to finalize tonight
- This is the next build priority after market fixes

### Cron Jobs Failing
- Multiple isolated cron jobs hitting "credit balance too low" on Anthropic (claude-opus-4-5)
- Jobs affected: data validation, auto-QA, data consistency, daily research
- Need to either top up credits or update cron jobs to use different model
- Haven't told Sam yet — lower priority vs. Oracle work

### QA Sweep (8:00 AM)
- All routes 200 ✅
- All 6 indices showing live data ✅
- Logged to memory/qa/2026-02-12.md
