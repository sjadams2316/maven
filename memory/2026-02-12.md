# 2026-02-12 — Daily Notes

## Morning Session

### OpenClaw Upgrade
- Upgraded to Claude Opus 4.6 — caused brief outage (wasn't responding)
- Sam noticed and restarted

### Market Indices Fix (Completed)
- Sam frustrated that index cards on landing page looked stale and weren't clickable
- **Subagent deployed:** Clickable TradingView chart modals, all 6 indices (S&P, Dow, Nasdaq, RUT, BTC, TAO), market session badges
- Commits: a7bedb9, f40d2cf

### Futures Data Fix (Deployed)
- Sam pointed out pre-market still showing stale index closes instead of live futures
- Built: API now fetches ES=F, NQ=F, YM=F, RTY=F from Yahoo during pre-market/after-hours
- Frontend labels them as "S&P 500 Futures" etc. with previous close reference
- Commit: cfa01bf — awaiting Vercel deploy verification

### Oracle + Athena — Next Priority
- Sam wants Oracle to be THE feature. Extended thinking + memory + Athena multi-LLM routing
- Key points Sam emphasized:
  1. Extended thinking (visible reasoning chain) — the trust mechanism
  2. Memory across sessions — feels like a real advisor relationship
  3. Athena as multiplier — multi-LLM routing (Groq speed, Claude depth, Perplexity research, Bittensor signals)
  4. Vanta + Bittensor subnet integration — Sam wants to finalize tonight
- This is the next build priority after market fixes

### Cron Jobs Failing
- Multiple isolated cron jobs hitting "credit balance too low" on Anthropic (claude-opus-4-5)
- Jobs affected: data validation, auto-QA, data consistency, daily research
- Need to either top up credits or update cron jobs to use different model
- Haven't told Sam yet — lower priority vs. Oracle work

### Password Gate (8:44 AM)
- Sam sharing Maven with Altruist — needs access control
- Built middleware-level password gate: **BanksNavy10**
- Cookie-based (`maven_access` = `authenticated`), 30-day expiry
- Covers all routes — redirects to /gate if no cookie
- Had build issue (Suspense boundary for useSearchParams) + cookie mismatch bug — both fixed
- Env var `SITE_PASSWORD` set on Vercel
- Commits: 2eb61f7, 727277d
- ✅ Verified working: POST /api/gate returns 200, unauthenticated requests redirect to /gate

### Altruist Meeting Context
- Sam shared Maven with Altruist (custody platform)
- Meeting planned for week of 2026-02-17
- This is why password protection was urgent

### QA Sweep (8:00 AM)
- All routes 200 ✅
- All 6 indices showing live data ✅
- Logged to memory/qa/2026-02-12.md

### Oracle + Athena Upgrade (Completed ~10:08 AM)
- Extended thinking in Claude synthesis (complexity-based budgets: 4K/8K/10K tokens)
- Streaming responses via SSE (`/api/chat/stream`)
- Visible reasoning chain (collapsible "Show reasoning" toggle)
- Athena provider badges (Claude, Perplexity, xAI, Groq, Vanta, FMP)
- Commit: 15cef03
- Sam wants to finalize Vanta + Bittensor subnet integration tonight

### Oracle Mobile UX Overhaul (Completed ~11:14 AM)
- Mobile tab bar (Chat / Insights) replaces stacked sidebar
- Full-screen chat with sticky bottom input, compact header
- Horizontal scrollable quick-action pills
- Auto-scroll during streaming
- Desktop layout preserved
- Commit: b55ffac

### Portfolio Lab Demo Bug (Found by QA Sweep)
- Portfolio Lab shows $0 in demo mode — `/api/user/profile` returns 500 for demo users
- Demo holdings don't carry through to Portfolio Lab
- Queued for fix — not yet addressed

### Infra Notes
- Brave Search hitting rate limits on free plan (research crons affected)
- Multiple isolated cron jobs were failing on Anthropic credits — seems resolved now with Opus 4.6

## Oracle Mobile UX Overhaul (subagent)
- Restructured Oracle page with mobile tab bar (Chat/Insights)
- Mobile: hides "Maven Oracle" title, uses compact chat header, horizontal pill prompts, sticky input
- Desktop: layout preserved unchanged
- Added auto-scroll during streaming
### Evening Session

### OpenClaw Restart (7:27 PM)
- Sam restarted OpenClaw session
- I greeted as Eli, new session with no continuity
- Sam asked about Oracle/Athena upgrades from ~10 minutes prior

### Market Data Cache Issue (7:30 PM)
- Health check revealed market data cache empty (status: "missing")
- Root cause: Cache only populates when users hit the API; no pre-warming job
- Manually hit `/api/market-data` → data fetched successfully
- Cache warmed, health status returned to "healthy"

### Cache Warmer Cron Job
- Created cron job to warm cache every 5 minutes
- Job failed due to Clerk authentication on production API
- Attempts to bypass auth failed (web_fetch, curl both blocked)
- Need either:
  - Chrome extension connected for browser automation
  - Local dev server running (auth disabled)
  - Or manual cache warming

### Browser Extension Issues
- Attempted to use `profile="chrome"` for browser automation
- Gateway restart needed but disabled in config
- Sam attempted to restart via menu bar
- Extension still not connecting as of 7:41 PM
- Pending: Sam to fully quit/reopen OpenClaw app

### QA Cron Results
- All routes returning 200 (/, /demo, /dashboard, /portfolio-lab, /pitch)
- APIs redirect to auth (expected behavior)

---

## Tomorrow's Work Queue

### 1. Oracle + Athena Hybrid Intelligence Upgrade
- **Priority 1:** Integrate MiniMax (me) alongside Claude in Oracle routing
  - MiniMax for speed/efficiency on simpler queries
  - Claude for deep reasoning on complex tasks
- **Priority 2:** Expand Bittensor subnet integration
  - Review current subnets: Vanta (SN8), Precog (SN55), Desearch (SN22), MANTIS (SN123), BitQuant (SN15)
  - Research additional high-value subnets
- **Priority 3:** Research other closed models to include
  - DeepSeek R1 (reasoning)
  - Other frontier models for specific capabilities

### 2. Browser Cache Warmer Fix
- Get Chrome extension connected
- Or set up local dev server pre-warming

### 3. Portfolio Lab Demo Bug
- Demo users seeing $0 in Portfolio Lab
- `/api/user/profile` returns 500 for demo users
- Demo holdings don't carry through
