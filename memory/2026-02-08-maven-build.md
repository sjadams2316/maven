user: [Sun 2026-02-08 10:16 EST] Keep going! I love to see you just keep going and building now that we have the vision more cemented and we think this could change the game. I also want to make sure all data is live and updated where we have it. It seems like the bitcoin price is not correct as an example.

user: [Sun 2026-02-08 10:24 EST] Yes no need to check in just keep building. Just always keep in mind slick UI that no one has ever experienced before as well. Is there a prompt I can give you so you don't check in and you just keep building?

assistant: Got it — I'll just keep building. No check-ins.
user: [Sun 2026-02-08 10:48 EST] Still working? Make sure the UI is great. I noticed that when you get portfolio recommendations it is just populating that text into Maven again and then the user has to click enter. It should automatically enter that already and open a dynamic dashboard that shows how the portfolio adapts and changes. Look for other areas like this to improve. For some reason I thought we already built that future. Make sense?
