## Active Threads

### Sam's Jump Timing
**Status:** Ongoing discussion
**Question:** When does Sam leave Capital Group for Maven full-time?
**Current Thinking:**
- Not yet — need proof of traction first
- Jon goes first with existing clients
- Sam joins when math makes sense
**What Would Trigger Jump:**
- [ ] Jon's AUM hits $X
- [ ] Maven Pro revenue hits $Y
- [ ] Raise a round that provides runway
- [ ] (Sam to define specific thresholds)

### Morningstar Integration Priority
**Status:** Evaluating
**Question:** When to invest $25-50K/year in Morningstar data?
**Pros:**
- X-ray analysis, fund holdings
- Proprietary ratings (star system)
- Institutional credibility
**Cons:**
- Significant cost before revenue
- Can build a lot without it
**Decision Point:** After first 5-10 clients validate MVP

### Plaid Account Aggregation
**Status:** Next priority
**Question:** When to integrate Plaid (~$500/mo)?
**Why It Matters:**
- "Client brain" requires seeing all accounts
- Can't do holistic advice with partial view
- Moat: data accumulation
**Blocker:** Need to decide timing vs. other priorities

### 401(k) Advice Scope
**Status:** Phased approach decided
**Current Plan:**
1. Phase 1: Aggregation only (show 401k alongside everything)
2. Phase 2: Educational analysis (fees, allocation)
3. Phase 3: Full ERISA fiduciary (rollover advice)
**Open Question:** When to pursue Phase 3?

### Maven Personal Launch Timing
**Question:** When does direct-to-consumer make sense?
**Current View:** After RIA proves the model

### Bittensor Integration
**Question:** How does TAO/Bittensor fit into Maven?
**Ideas:**
- Decentralized AI signals
- Differentiated data sources
- Align with Sam's investment thesis

### Team Building
**Question:** When do we need humans?
**Roles Discussed:**
- Tech-native planners (get tech AND planning AND charisma)
