*Research Date: February 2026*

## Executive Summary

The SEC Marketing Rule (Rule 206(4)-1), adopted in December 2020 and effective November 4, 2022, fundamentally transformed how investment advisers can market their services. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current regulatory framework governing RIA marketing and advertising, with practical guidance for Maven's growth strategy.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Testimonials and endorsements are now **permitted** (previously banned for 60+ years)
- Performance advertising has clearer but stricter requirements
- Social media is explicitly addressable under the new framework
- All marketing must avoid being "materially misleading"
- Compliance policies and procedures are mandatory

---

## 1. SEC Marketing Rule (Rule 206(4)-1) — The 2021 Overhaul

### 1.1 What Changed from the Old Rules?

The new Marketing Rule replaced two legacy frameworks:
- **Former Rule 206(4)-1** (Advertising Rule, from 1961)
- **Former Rule 206(4)-3** (Cash Solicitation Rule, from 1979)

**Major Changes:**

| Area | Old Rules | New Marketing Rule |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Testimonials | **Prohibited** | Permitted with disclosures |
| Endorsements | Required cash payment disclosure only | Comprehensive disclosure requirements |
| Performance | Vague prohibitions on "misleading" claims | Specific requirements for gross/net, time periods |
| Social Media | Ambiguous, often avoided | Explicitly covered as "advertisement" |
| Hypothetical Performance | Generally prohibited | Permitted with guardrails |
| Third-Party Ratings | Unclear treatment | Specific conditions required |

### 1.2 Key Requirements

The rule establishes **seven general prohibitions** — any advertisement is unlawful if it:

1. **Includes untrue statements** of material fact, or omits material facts making statements misleading
2. **Makes unsubstantiable claims** — adviser must have reasonable basis to substantiate statements upon SEC demand
3. **Creates misleading implications** through material statements
4. **Cherry-picks benefits** without fair and balanced treatment of material risks and limitations
5. **Presents specific investment advice unfairly** — must be balanced
6. **Manipulates performance presentation** — time periods and results must be fair and balanced
7. **Is otherwise materially misleading** (catch-all provision)

### 1.3 Implementation Timeline

- **December 22, 2020**: Rule adopted
- **May 4, 2021**: Rule published in Federal Register
- **November 4, 2022**: Compliance date (18-month transition)
- **Present**: Full enforcement in effect

### 1.4 Definition of "Advertisement"

An advertisement includes:
- **Direct or indirect communications** to more than one person offering advisory services
- **Communications to one person** that include hypothetical performance
- **Compensated testimonials and endorsements** (even one-on-one)

**NOT advertisements:**
- Extemporaneous, live, oral communications
- Statutory or regulatory filings
- One-on-one communications without hypothetical performance
- Responses to unsolicited requests for hypothetical performance

---

## 2. Testimonials and Endorsements

### 2.1 Definitions

**Testimonial**: Statement by a **current client or investor** about:
- Their experience with the adviser
- Soliciting others to become clients
- Referring others to the adviser

**Endorsement**: Statement by **someone other than a current client** that:
- Indicates approval, support, or recommendation
- Solicits clients/investors
- Refers clients/investors

### 2.2 Required Disclosures

For **all** testimonials and endorsements, must disclose **clearly and prominently**:

1. **Status disclosure**: Whether the person is a current client (testimonial) or not (endorsement)
2. **Compensation disclosure**: Whether cash or non-cash compensation was provided
3. **Conflicts disclosure**: Brief statement of material conflicts from the relationship

**Additional disclosures** (can be less prominent):
- Material terms of compensation arrangements
- Description of material conflicts

### 2.3 Adviser Oversight Requirements

Investment advisers must:
1. Have **reasonable basis** for believing testimonial/endorsement complies with rules
2. Maintain **written agreement** describing scope and compensation terms

### 2.4 Disqualification Rules

Cannot compensate "ineligible persons" — those subject to:
- Felony/misdemeanor convictions involving specified conduct (10-year lookback)
- Certain court orders or regulatory actions
- SEC cease-and-desist orders for fraud

### 2.5 Exemptions from Full Requirements

| Situation | Exemption |
|-----------|-----------|
| No compensation or **de minimis** ($1,000 or less per 12 months) | No written agreement required; no disqualification check |
| Employees/affiliates | No status/compensation disclosure if affiliation is apparent |
| Registered broker-dealers | Reduced disclosure requirements |

### 2.6 Sample Compliant Testimonial Disclosure

> *"[Name] is a current client of [Adviser]. [He/She] was not compensated for this testimonial. [Name]'s experience may not be representative of other clients' experiences."*

Or if compensated:

> *"[Name] is a current client of [Adviser] and received [description of compensation] for providing this testimonial. [Name] may have a conflict of interest due to [describe conflict]. [Name]'s experience may not be representative of other clients' experiences."*

## 3. Performance Advertising Requirements

### 3.1 Gross vs. Net Performance

**Critical Rule**: Any advertisement showing **gross performance** must also show **net performance** with:
- **Equal prominence** to gross performance
- **Comparable format** to facilitate comparison
- **Same time period** as gross performance
- **Same methodology** (same type of return calculation)

**Gross Performance** = Returns before deducting all fees and expenses
**Net Performance** = Returns after deducting all fees and expenses a client paid or would have paid

### 3.2 Time Period Requirements

Performance advertisements (except private funds) **must include** returns for:
- **1-year period**
- **5-year period** 
- **10-year period**

All periods must:
- Be presented with **equal prominence**
- End on a date no less recent than **most recent calendar year-end**
- If portfolio didn't exist for full period, use **life of portfolio**

### 3.3 Types of Performance

| Type | Definition | Requirements |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Related Performance** | Performance of portfolios with substantially similar strategies | Must include ALL related portfolios unless exclusion doesn't materially raise returns |
| **Extracted Performance** | Subset of investments from a portfolio | Must offer/provide total portfolio performance |
| **Predecessor Performance** | Performance from accounts at a prior firm | Strict conditions: same people, similar accounts, clear disclosure |
| **Hypothetical Performance** | Performance not actually achieved | Special policies, disclosures on limitations/assumptions |

### 3.4 Hypothetical Performance Rules

Includes:
- Model portfolios
- Backtested strategies
- Targeted/projected returns

**Requirements:**
1. Adopt policies ensuring it's **relevant to intended audience**
2. Provide information on **criteria and assumptions**
3. Provide information on **risks and limitations**

**Exempt from 1/5/10-year requirements** but subject to other protections.

### 3.5 Benchmark Comparisons

When comparing to benchmarks:
- Benchmark must be **relevant** to strategy
- Must disclose if benchmark is **not comparable**
- Cannot cherry-pick favorable benchmark periods

### 3.6 What You CANNOT Do

- State or imply SEC **approved or reviewed** your performance calculations
- Present **misleading time periods** (e.g., only best years)
- Show **gross without net** performance
- Exclude related portfolios to **inflate returns**

---

## 4. Social Media Compliance

### 4.1 What Can You Post?

Social media posts **are advertisements** if they:
- Offer advisory services to prospective clients
- Are directed to more than one person
- Include hypothetical performance

**Permitted content:**
- Educational content about investing concepts
- Market commentary and thought leadership
- Firm culture and team introductions
- General descriptions of services
- Links to compliant website content

**Requires compliance review:**
- Specific investment recommendations
- Performance claims
- Testimonials or client success stories
- Endorsements from third parties

### 4.2 Third-Party Posts and "Adoption"

**The "adoption" doctrine**: If an adviser republishes, shares, or links to third-party content, they may **adopt** it as their own advertisement.

**Adoption triggers:**
- Sharing/retweeting with implicit endorsement
- Linking prominently on firm website
- Paying for or incentivizing the content

**To avoid adoption:**
- Be clear the views are not the adviser's
- Don't edit or modify third-party content to appear as your own
- Don't pay for favorable reviews/posts

### 4.3 Recordkeeping for Social Media

Under Rule 204-2(a)(11), must keep records of:
- All advertisements disseminated
- All communications related to recommendations or advice

**For social media:**
- Archive all posts, comments, direct messages with clients
- Maintain records for **5 years** (first 2 years easily accessible)
- Include deleted posts that were disseminated

**Best practices:**
- Use social media archiving tools (Smarsh, Global Relay, etc.)
- Implement pre-approval workflows
- Train employees on compliant posting

### 4.4 Influencer Partnerships

Working with influencers = **paid endorsements** under the rule.

**Requirements:**
- Written agreement with influencer
- Required disclosures in influencer's posts
- Due diligence on influencer's background (disqualification check)
- Influencer cannot be an "ineligible person"
- Adviser oversight of content

**Disclosures influencer must make:**
- That they're not a client (unless they are)
- That they received compensation
- Material conflicts of interest

### 4.5 Platform-Specific Considerations

| Platform | Key Considerations |
|----------|-------------------|
| **LinkedIn** | Professional focus; testimonials from connections may need disclosure |
| **Twitter/X** | Character limits challenge disclosure requirements; link to full disclosures |
| **YouTube** | Video testimonials need verbal + written disclosures |
| **Instagram** | Visual focus; ensure disclosures aren't buried; Stories require same compliance |
| **TikTok** | Fast-paced format; disclosures must be clear despite brevity |

---

## 5. Website Content Requirements

### 5.1 Required Disclosures on Websites

While not an exhaustive list, compliant RIA websites should include:

1. **Form ADV Part 2A Brochure** — link or access
2. **Form CRS** (if applicable) — prominent link
3. **Privacy Policy** — required under Reg S-P
4. **Testimonial/endorsement disclosures** — when used
5. **Performance disclosures** — methodology, limitations
6. **Material conflicts of interest**

### 5.2 Prohibited Claims

**Never state or imply:**
- "SEC-registered" means SEC approved your skill or qualifications
- Guaranteed returns or outcomes
- Risk-free investing
- Superior performance without substantiation
- Certainty about future results

### 5.3 Fee Disclosure

While the Marketing Rule doesn't mandate specific fee disclosure, **best practice** and Form ADV requirements mean:

- Disclose fee structure clearly
- If showing net performance, use actual or highest fees charged
- Don't hide fees in fine print when claiming "low cost"

### 5.4 Website Best Practices

- **Date your content** — especially market commentary
- **Archive old versions** — for compliance record
- **Use clear, accessible language** — avoid misleading jargon
- **Mobile-responsive disclosures** — can't rely on desktop-only disclaimers
- **Regular compliance reviews** — at least annually

## 6. "General Solicitation" Rules

### 6.1 Reg D and General Solicitation

For private fund advisers raising capital under **Regulation D Rule 506**:

**Rule 506(b)**: No general solicitation permitted
- Cannot advertise the offering publicly
- Limited to pre-existing relationships

**Rule 506(c)**: General solicitation permitted IF:
- All purchasers are accredited investors
- Adviser takes reasonable steps to verify accredited status

### 6.2 Implications for RIA Marketing

If Maven advises private funds:
- Marketing of the **advisory firm** is generally permitted
- Marketing of **specific fund offerings** has Reg D constraints
- Keep "capabilities marketing" separate from "offering materials"
