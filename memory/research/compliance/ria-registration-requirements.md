# RIA Registration Requirements: Deep Research for Maven

**Research Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Prepared for:** Sam Adams and Jon Adams (Maven AI-Native RIA)

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive research on Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) registration requirements, compliance obligations, and ongoing regulatory duties. The information is primarily sourced from SEC.gov official guidance, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, IARD documentation, state securities regulators (NASAA), compliance consultants, and law firm guides.

**Key Findings:**
- **Registration Threshold:** $100M+ RAUM requires SEC registration; under $100M registers with state(s)
- **Buffer Zone:** State-registered firms with $100M-$110M RAUM *may* but aren't *required* to register with SEC
- **Timeline:** Expect 45-90 days from start to approval for new RIA registration
- **Compliance Time:** Solo RIAs can manage compliance with ~2% of annual working hours (1 hr/month, 4 hrs/quarter, 8 hrs/year for annual tasks)
- **CCO Requirement:** Must have named CCO (can be firm principal); cannot fully outsource but can use compliance consultants
- **Examination Rate:** SEC examines approximately 15-17% of RIAs annually

## 1. SEC vs. State Registration Thresholds

### The $100 Million Rule

The dividing line between SEC and state registration is based on **Regulatory Assets Under Management (RAUM)**:

| RAUM Level | Registration Requirement |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Under $100M | State registration required |
| $100M - $110M | May choose SEC or state (buffer zone) |
| $110M+ | SEC registration required |
| $90M - $100M (already SEC) | May remain SEC-registered (buffer zone) |
| Under $90M (already SEC) | Must switch to state registration |

**Legal Authority:** Section 203A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act (2010), established these thresholds.

**Source:** [17 CFR § 275.203A-1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/275.203A-1)

### Important Exceptions

1. **New York Exception:** Advisers with principal place of business in New York must register with SEC if RAUM is **$25 million or more** (because NY doesn't examine state-registered advisers).

2. **Multi-State Advisers:** RIAs required to register in **15 or more states** may register with SEC regardless of AUM.

3. **Investment Company Advisers:** Advisers to registered investment companies (mutual funds, ETFs) must register with SEC regardless of AUM.

4. **Internet-Only Advisers:** Can register with SEC regardless of AUM under specific conditions.

5. **120-Day Rule:** New advisers may register with SEC if they reasonably expect to reach $100M within 120 days.

### Key Timing Considerations

- Registration requirements are triggered by **year-end RAUM** as reported on Form ADV Part 1A
- Mid-year threshold crossings don't require immediate action
- After filing annual ADV amendment showing eligibility, firm has **90 days** to apply for SEC registration
- SEC has **45 days** statutory maximum to approve or deny application

**Key Insight:** At current examination rates, an average RIA might go **6-7 years** between examinations. However, certain factors can increase likelihood of examination.

## 7. Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) Requirements

### Regulatory Requirement

Under **SEC Rule 206(4)-7** (Compliance Procedures and Practices), every SEC-registered investment adviser must:

> "Designate an individual (who is a supervised person) responsible for administering the policies and procedures that you adopt under paragraph (a) of this section."

### Can the CCO Be Outsourced?

**Short Answer:** No, not entirely.

**SEC Position:**
- The **named CCO must be a supervised person** of the adviser
- Cannot fully outsource the CCO role to a third party
- However, can use compliance consultants to **support** the CCO

**What CAN Be Outsourced:**
- Compliance consulting and advisory services
- Drafting policies and procedures
- Conducting annual compliance reviews
- Mock audits and examination preparation
- Day-to-day compliance task support
- Technology and monitoring systems

**What CANNOT Be Outsourced:**
- The ultimate responsibility for compliance
- The designation as Chief Compliance Officer
- Final decision-making on compliance matters
- Accountability to regulators

### CCO Responsibilities

1. Administer compliance policies and procedures
2. Ensure policies are reasonably designed to prevent violations
3. Conduct annual compliance review
4. Report compliance matters to senior management
5. Respond to regulatory examinations
6. Stay current on regulatory developments
7. Supervise compliance-related activities

### Disclosure Requirements

**Form ADV Part 2A, Item 19:**
- Must disclose CCO and other management persons
- If CCO has outside business activities, must disclose
- If using outsourced compliance support, consider disclosing arrangement

### Small Firm Considerations

For small (1-5 person) RIAs:
- CCO is typically the firm principal/owner
- May "wear multiple hats" (advisor + CCO)
- Should consider pairing with compliance consultant
- Average full-time CCO salary: $82,000-$226,000
- Only ~3% of firms under $100M AUM have dedicated full-time CCO

### Risk of Improper Outsourcing

The SEC has issued Risk Alerts warning about:
- Outsourced CCOs not sufficiently involved in firm activities
- Lack of knowledge about firm's actual business practices
- Inadequate supervision of third-party compliance providers
- Failure to customize compliance programs to firm's business

## Practical Implications for Maven

### Initial Registration Considerations

1. **Jurisdiction Determination**
   - If starting under $100M AUM: State registration required
   - If Jon brings over significant assets from Merrill: May affect threshold
   - Consider New York exception if NY-based principals

2. **Structure Recommendation**
   - LLC structure for tax efficiency and liability protection
   - Name at least one principal as CCO
   - Consider compliance consultant relationship from day one

3. **AI-Native Considerations**
   - Ensure compliance manual addresses AI/technology use
   - Document how AI recommendations are supervised
   - Consider cybersecurity requirements for AI systems
   - Marketing materials about AI must comply with Marketing Rule

### Ongoing Compliance Planning

1. **CCO Structure**
   - Designate internal CCO (likely Sam or Jon)
   - Partner with compliance consultant for support
   - Budget for compliance technology (~$500-1,000/month)

2. **Time Budget**
   - Plan for ~2% of working time on compliance
   - Monthly: 1-2 hours
   - Quarterly: 4-5 hours
   - Annually: 8-10 hours (concentrated around March)

3. **Key Deadlines**
   - March 31: Form ADV Annual Amendment
   - April 30: Brochure delivery to clients
   - December 31: IARD renewal fees
   - Quarterly: Personal trading reports (30 days after quarter end)

### Open Questions for Attorney Review

1. **AI-Specific:**
   - What disclosures are required for AI-generated advice?
   - How should we document AI supervision procedures?
   - Any state-specific regulations on robo-advice?

2. **Registration:**
   - Should we pursue SEC registration via internet adviser exemption?
   - Multi-state implications of AI-native model?
   - Custody implications of any planned features?

3. **Compliance:**
   - Does AI require modification to standard Code of Ethics?
   - Books and records requirements for AI model decisions?
   - Fiduciary duty considerations with AI recommendations?

4. **Marketing:**
   - Marketing Rule compliance for AI performance claims?
   - Testimonial/endorsement rules for AI-generated content?
   - Disclosure requirements for AI branding?
