# Maven Competitive Landscape Analysis
*Research Date: February 6, 2026*

Maven's expanded vision spans five interconnected domains:
1. **Account Aggregation** — See all accounts in one place
2. **Year-round Tax Optimization** — Tax-loss harvesting, Roth conversions, asset location
3. **Trading via Alpaca** — Execute trades programmatically
4. **Tax Filing** — Compete with TurboTax
5. **AI-Native Financial Intelligence** — The unifying thread

This document analyzes every significant competitor across these categories.

## 1. Robo-Advisors / Wealth Management

The robo-advisor industry now manages over **$1 trillion** globally, expected to reach **$7 trillion by 2029**.

### Vanguard Digital Advisor
| Metric | Value |

**What they do well:**
- Lowest fees in the industry (0.15%)
- Massive brand trust from Vanguard's $8T firm-wide AUM
- Access to human advisors at higher tiers

**Where they fall short:**
- Limited portfolio customization

---

### Betterment
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $56.4B (as of 2024, growing) |
| Clients | 1.1M+ |
| Fee | 0.25% (Digital), 0.65% (Premium) |
| Minimum | $0 (Digital), $100K (Premium) |
| 3Y Return | 4.30% annualized |

**What they do well:**
- Pioneer robo-advisor, strong brand
- Tax-loss harvesting included
- $0 minimum for basic tier
- Acquired Ellevest (Feb 2025) for broader reach

**Where they fall short:**

- Limited visibility into tax impact before trades
- No tax filing integration

---

### Wealthfront
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $75B |

| 3Y Return | 5.96% annualized (best in class) |

**What they do well:**

- **US Direct Indexing** at $100K+ (stock-level harvesting)
- Path financial planning tool
- Portfolio line of credit
- Cash account features

**Where they fall short:**
- Direct indexing requires $100K minimum
- **Smart Beta requires $500K** — wealth features gatekept
- Must transfer assets TO Wealthfront (no external optimization)
- No tax filing
- Can't prevent wash sales across external accounts

**Key insight:** Wealthfront claims tax-loss harvesting adds **1.8% after-tax return** on average — but only for assets INSIDE Wealthfront.

---

### Empower (formerly Personal Capital)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| AUM | $200B |
| Clients | 18M free users, 236K investment accounts |

| Minimum | $100K for wealth management |

**What they do well:**
- **Free account aggregation dashboard** (their hook)
- Retirement planner and fee analyzer

- Many users frustrated with sales calls

**Key insight:** Empower's business model is free aggregation → upsell to expensive advisory. The free tools are good but deliberately limited.

---

| AUM | $10B |
| Clients | 1M+ |
| Fee | $0 (free), $36/year or $3/mo for Plus |

| Minimum | $500 |

**What they do well:**
- **Active management with hedge-fund-style strategies**
- Transparent about holdings and rationale

- No tax optimization
- Niche appeal

---

### Ellevest

| Fee | $12/month flat |
| Minimum | $0 |

**What they do well:**
- **Gender-based salary curves and longevity planning** (unique approach)
- Flat fee model benefits larger accounts
- Focus on underserved market (women)

**Where they fall short:**

## 3. Tax Software

### TurboTax (Intuit)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Share | **60%** of U.S. consumer tax prep |
| Revenue | $4.9B (Consumer Group, FY2025) |

**What they do well:**

**What they do poorly:**
- **Expensive** (premium tiers $150+)
- Aggressive upselling during filing
- History of deceptive practices (FTC settlement)
- Year-round tax optimization? **Zero**
- No connection to your investment accounts

**Key insight:** TurboTax knows NOTHING about your portfolio until you upload tax forms. No year-round optimization.

---

| Pricing | $0-$85+ federal, $37-55/state |

**What they do:**
- AI-powered embedded tax filing for fintechs
- Tax forecasting and planning APIs
- Partners include banks and fintech apps
- White-label tax filing

**Why this matters:** April proves the market wants embedded tax. But April is **B2B infrastructure** — they're not building the consumer experience.

---

**What they do well:**
- **AI-powered tax-loss harvesting suggestions**

**Key insight:** Mezzi is the closest competitor to Maven's tax optimization vision — but they **don't execute trades**.

---

**Users:** 6M+  
**Focus:** Gen Z, cash flow management

---

## 5. All-in-One Attempts — Why They Failed

### Mint (RIP: January 2024)
**Peak Users:** 20M+  
**Acquired by:** Intuit (2009, for $170M)  
**Shut down:** January 2024

**Why it failed:**
1. **Business model conflict** — Free product meant ad-supported, which led to misaligned incentives
2. **Intuit redundancy** — After acquiring Credit Karma (2020), Mint was redundant
3. **No moat** — Pure aggregation commoditized
4. **Technical debt** — Aging platform, Plaid reliability issues
5. **No monetization path** — Users wouldn't pay, ads annoyed them

**Key lesson:** Free aggregation alone isn't a business. You need either:
- Upsell path (Empower → advisory)
- Transactional revenue (trading, tax filing)
- Premium features users will pay for

---

### Personal Capital → Empower Transition
**Acquired by:** Empower (2020)  
**Result:** Rebranded, free tools maintained as lead gen

**What worked:** Free tools → wealth management funnel  
**What's broken:** Users hate the sales calls. Reddit full of complaints about aggressive outreach.

## 6. Gap Analysis: What's Missing

| Capability | Who Does It | Gap |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Account aggregation | Empower, Copilot, Monarch | ✅ Well-served |
| Tax-loss harvesting (own assets) | Wealthfront, Betterment | ✅ Available |
| Tax-loss harvesting (all accounts) | **NO ONE** | ❌ **MAVEN OPPORTUNITY** |
| Roth conversion optimization | MaxiFi, spreadsheets | ❌ No consumer product |
| Asset location optimization | Financial advisors only | ❌ **MAVEN OPPORTUNITY** |
| Trade execution + tax awareness | **NO ONE** | ❌ **MAVEN OPPORTUNITY** |
| Year-round tax strategy | **NO ONE** | ❌ **MAVEN OPPORTUNITY** |
| Tax filing with investment context | **NO ONE** | ❌ **MAVEN OPPORTUNITY** |
| AI financial intelligence | Mezzi (limited), Cleo (budgeting) | Emerging |

---

## Where Maven Wins

### The Specific Gaps Maven Fills

1. **Cross-Account Tax Optimization**
   - Wealthfront/Betterment only optimize assets INSIDE their platform
   - Mezzi gives suggestions but can't execute
   - **Maven can see ALL accounts and optimize across them**

2. **Tax-Aware Trading**
   - Every other platform: Trade → find out tax impact later
   - **Maven: Know exact tax impact BEFORE you trade**

3. **Year-Round Tax Strategy**
   - TurboTax exists 3 months/year
   - **Maven makes tax optimization continuous**

4. **Roth Conversion + Asset Location for Consumers**
   - Currently requires $500K+ and a financial advisor
   - MaxiFi exists but it's spreadsheet-style software
   - **Maven democratizes sophisticated tax strategies**

5. **The Full Loop**
   - No one does: Aggregate → Analyze → Optimize → Trade → File
   - Wealthfront: Manage → Trade (no external, no filing)
   - TurboTax: File (no year-round)
   - Empower: Aggregate → Upsell
   - **Maven closes the entire loop**

6. **AI-Native Architecture**
   - Existing players are adding AI as a feature
   - **Maven is AI-first: the intelligence IS the product**

### Why This Hasn't Been Done

1. **Regulatory complexity** — Tax advice + trading + filing = multiple regulators (SEC, IRS)
2. **Technical challenge** — Requires aggregation, tax engine, trading API, AI integration
3. **Business model** — Hard to monetize without AUM fees or being annoying
4. **Incumbents have conflicts** — Wealthfront wants your assets INSIDE Wealthfront
5. **Startups focused on point solutions** — Easier to do one thing well

### Maven's Structural Advantages

1. **Alpaca partnership** enables trading without becoming a broker-dealer
2. **AI-native** means tax code changes become feature improvements, not rewrites
3. **No AUM conflict** — Maven can optimize across ALL your accounts
4. **Full-loop value** justifies subscription pricing without annoying ads or upsells
