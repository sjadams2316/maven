# Tokenization & The Future of Wealth Management (2026-2029)

*Research compiled: February 6, 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Tokenization is transitioning from experimental pilot programs to production-grade financial infrastructure. The convergence of regulatory clarity (GENIUS Act, SEC guidance on tokenized securities), institutional adoption (BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, JPMorgan), and infrastructure maturation (Chainlink CCIP, Securitize) creates a 3-5 year window where the tokenized asset landscape will fundamentally reshape personal finance and wealth management.

**Key Projections:**
- **$30B** tokenized RWAs today → **$2-30 trillion** by 2030 (range reflects methodology differences)
- **7-9%** of investor portfolios allocated to tokenized assets by 2027 (EY survey)
- **$300B+** stablecoin supply, processing $9T annually (adjusted)
- **$3B** in BlackRock BUIDL fund alone (largest tokenized treasury product)

## 3. Regulatory Landscape

### SEC Stance on Tokenized Securities

**Key 2025-2026 Developments:**

1. **Statement on Tokenized Securities (Jan 28, 2026):**
   - Joint statement from Divisions of Corporation Finance, Investment Management, Trading and Markets
   - **Issuer-sponsored tokens** = true equity ownership
   - **Third-party tokens** = custodial arrangements or synthetic instruments
   - Tokenization doesn't change securities law application
   - Warning: Many tokenized stocks provide "synthetic exposure rather than real equity ownership"

2. **DTCC No-Action Letter (Dec 11, 2025):**
   - 3-year relief for DTC tokenization services
   - Enables 24/7 peer-to-peer transfers
   - "Immobilization" of shares in custody
   - Foundation for institutional tokenization

3. **Rule 15c3-3 Guidance (Dec 17, 2025):**
   - Broker-dealer custody rules for crypto asset securities
   - Applies to tokenized equity/debt securities
   - Material security/operational problems bar custody

4. **Nasdaq Tokenized Trading (Jan 30, 2026):**
   - Filed to amend rules for trading securities in tokenized form
   - Pilot program under DTCC no-action relief

### Stablecoin Regulation

**GENIUS Act (Passed 2025):**
- Bipartisan federal stablecoin framework
- Clarity for payment stablecoins
- Reserve requirements and audit standards
- Enabled Circle IPO and institutional adoption

**CLARITY Act (House Approved 2025):**
- Market structure and digital asset oversight
- Complements GENIUS Act for comprehensive framework

### Custody Rules

- Broker-dealers can custody digital asset securities under specific conditions
- Must not have known material security vulnerabilities
- DLT and network operational standards required
- Qualified custodian requirements for investment advisers

### Tax Implications

**IRS Digital Asset Rules:**
- **2025**: Brokers must report gross proceeds for digital asset sales
- **2026**: Brokers must report cost basis
- **2026**: Real estate professionals must report FMV of digital assets in transactions

**Key Considerations:**
- Tokenized securities potentially subject to wash sale rules
- Unregulated tokens treated as property (no wash sale rules)
- RWA income (fractional rent, fund distributions) creates complex reporting
- 704(c) property rules apply to contributed appreciated real estate tokens
- IRS expected to issue specific RWA guidance in coming years

## 4. Implications for Wealth Management

### How Maven Handles Tokenized Assets

**The Aggregation Challenge:**
A modern portfolio in 2029 might include:
- Traditional brokerage (Schwab, Fidelity)
- Crypto exchange accounts (Coinbase, Kraken)
- Tokenized real estate (Lofty, RealT tokens)
- Tokenized PE (Hamilton Lane/Securitize tokens)
- Tokenized treasuries (BUIDL, Ondo USDY)
- DeFi positions (lending, liquidity provision)
- Multi-chain assets (Ethereum, Solana, Base)

**Maven Opportunity:**
No platform currently unifies all these. The aggregator that can:
1. Pull data across chains and custody solutions
2. Track cost basis across tokenized and traditional assets
3. Provide unified performance reporting
4. Generate tax reports across all asset types

...becomes the essential tool for the next generation of wealth management.

### Portfolio Tracking for Tokens

**Technical Requirements:**
- Multi-chain indexing (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Base, etc.)
- Smart contract interaction monitoring
- Yield/distribution tracking (daily rent from real estate tokens)
- Cross-chain bridge transaction reconciliation
- DEX swap tracking

**Data Sources:**
- On-chain data providers (Alchemy, The Graph, Chainalysis)
- RWA-specific APIs (Securitize, Lofty, Ondo)
- Traditional brokerage APIs (Plaid, Yodlee, direct integrations)

### Tax Implications of Tokenized RWAs

**Complexity Explosion:**
1. **Real Estate Tokens**: 
   - Daily rent distributions = ordinary income events
   - Token sales = capital gains/losses
   - Property depreciation pass-through?
   - State property tax implications

2. **Tokenized Securities**:
   - Subject to wash sale rules if SEC-registered
   - Dividend tracking across chains
   - Corporate actions (splits, dividends) on blockchain

3. **PE/Alternative Tokens**:
   - K-1 equivalent reporting
   - Carried interest treatment
   - Capital call/distribution tracking

4. **Cross-Chain Complexity**:
   - Bridge transactions may trigger taxable events
   - Chain-specific cost basis tracking required

**Maven Tax Opportunity:**
- First comprehensive RWA tax tracking solution
- Integration with tax software (TurboTax, H&R Block)
- CPA-ready reports for novel asset classes

### Fractional Ownership Changes Everything

**Traditional Wealth Management:**
- Minimums: $250K+ for PE, $25K+ for hedge funds
- Access: Accredited investors only for most alternatives
- Liquidity: Lock-ups of 7-10 years typical

**Tokenized Future:**
- Minimums: $50-$1,000
- Access: Reg A+, Reg CF expanding to retail
- Liquidity: 24/7 secondary markets emerging

**Implications:**
- Democratized access to institutional-quality investments
- Portfolio construction at every wealth level includes alternatives
- Rebalancing becomes continuous, not quarterly
- Advisors need new frameworks for asset allocation
