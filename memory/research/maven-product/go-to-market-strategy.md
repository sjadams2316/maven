# Maven Go-to-Market Strategy

*AI-Native Wealth Platform | Bootstrapped/Lean Startup Approach*
*Research compiled: February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Maven is entering the wealth management market at an inflection point: 67% of Gen Z and 62% of millennials already use AI for personal finance, and 41% would trust AI to manage their investments. The robo-advisor market is growing at 29.7% CAGR. The opportunity is real, but so is the competition.

This GTM strategy focuses on capital-efficient growth tactics proven by successful fintechs like Robinhood (1M waitlist pre-launch), Wealthfront ($4.6B AUM through referrals), and Monzo (5M users via gamified waitlist). Sam's Capital Group network provides a unique distribution advantage for the B2B/Pro tier.

**Key Recommendation:** Launch with a strong waitlist/referral mechanic, target tech-forward millennials (25-35) first, and use Sam's network to simultaneously build the RIA/Pro channel.

---

## 1. Target Customer Segments (Prioritized)

### Tier 1: Tech-Forward Millennials (Primary)
**Who:** 25-35 year olds in tech/knowledge work, $75K-$200K income
**Why First:**
- 90% of Wealthfront users are under 45
- 66.5% of millennials want AI in investment recommendations
- They're in "wealth accumulation phase" (Wealthfront's Rachleff)
- Most comfortable with AI-first products
- Highest social sharing propensity

**Psychographic Profile:**
- Overwhelmed by financial complexity
- Hate traditional finance ("guys in suits")
- Want sophisticated outcomes without the work
- Trust technology over human advisors
- Value transparency in fees
- 53% would switch companies after one bad customer service experience

**What Motivates Them:**
- "Set it and forget it" automation
- Tax optimization without complexity
- Feeling smart about money without being a finance expert
- Seeing their money grow while they sleep

### Tier 2: Mass Affluent DIY Investors
**Who:** 35-50, $150K-$500K investable assets, currently self-managing
**Why Second:**
- Already engaged with their finances
- Have money to invest
- Pain points around tax optimization, rebalancing, estate planning
- Willing to pay for convenience/outcomes

**What Motivates Them:**
- Tax savings (Wealthfront's tax-loss harvesting adds 1.8% after-tax returns on average)
- Consolidation of scattered accounts
- Professional-grade features without advisor fees
- Peace of mind during market volatility

### Tier 3: High Net Worth (via Maven Pro / RIA Channel)
**Who:** $500K+ investable assets, often with advisors
**Why Later:**
- Longer sales cycle
- Requires trust/relationships
- But: Sam's network gives access
- B2B channel through RIAs

**Best Approach:** Sell to RIAs/advisors first, then reach HNW clients through them

### Who to Avoid (For Now)
- Retirees (wealth preservation, not accumulation)
- Active traders (wrong product fit)
- Crypto-native users (unless Maven has crypto features)
- People with < $5K to invest (high support cost, low LTV)

---

## 2. Distribution Channels

### Direct Channels

**Website + Waitlist (Priority 1)**
- Robinhood built 1M waitlist pre-launch with a single landing page
- Simple mechanic: enter email → see position → share to move up
- Create FOMO through exclusivity ("early access")
- Key: One clear CTA, one powerful hook

**App Stores (Priority 2)**
- Wealthfront dropped minimum from $5K to $500 to broaden access
- Consider starting mobile-first given millennial preference
- ASO optimization for terms like "AI investing," "automated wealth"

### Content Marketing / SEO (Long-term Moat)

**High-Value SEO Opportunities:**
- "Best personal finance app" keywords
- Tax optimization content (seasonal, evergreen)
- "How to invest" educational content
- AI investing explained
- Comparison pages (vs. Wealthfront, vs. TurboTax)

**Content Strategy:**
- Finance is YMYL (Your Money Your Life) in Google's eyes
- Need E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust)
- Sam's credentials add authority
- Long-form, high-quality content over time
- Tools/calculators drive backlinks naturally

**Key Topics to Own:**
1. AI-powered tax optimization
2. Automated wealth building for millennials
3. Understanding your 401k (educational)
4. Tax-loss harvesting explained
5. When DIY investing isn't worth it

### Social Media Strategy

**LinkedIn (Sam's Primary)**
- 590M+ professionals, 98% of Fortune 500 use it
- Best for: Founder thought leadership, B2B/RIA outreach
- Sam should post 3-5x/week on:
  - Industry insights from Capital Group experience
  - AI in finance perspectives
  - Maven building journey
  - Personal finance tips
- Goal: Build authority before launch

**Twitter/X (Finance Twitter)**
- Active fintech community, finance creators
- Good for: Product updates, hot takes, engagement
- Connect with finance influencers
- Real-time market commentary

**TikTok/Instagram (FinTok)**
- Vivian Tu (@your.richbff) has 5M+ followers
- Gen Z discovers finance here
- Short-form educational content
- More casual, personality-driven
- Consider later unless Eli becomes the face

**Reddit (Community Building)**
- r/personalfinance, r/financialindependence are huge
- Be genuine, add value, don't spam
- AMA potential once product is live
- Can drive significant traffic organically

**Discord (Beta Community)**
- Build engaged early adopter community
- Feedback loop during beta
- Creates advocates who will spread word

### Influencer/Creator Partnerships

**Approach:**
- Finance influencers ("finfluencers") have loyal, engaged audiences
- SoFi partners with creators like Vivian Tu
- Authenticity matters—pick creators whose audience matches target

**Types of Partnerships:**
1. Sponsored content (paid, obvious)
2. Affiliate/referral (performance-based)
3. Advisory relationships (equity/long-term)
4. Early access to creators who genuinely love product

**Key Finfluencers to Target:**
- YouTube personal finance creators
- FinTok personalities
- Finance podcasters (Ramit Sethi's network, etc.)

### Product Hunt Launch

**Best Practices:**
- Time launch for Tuesday/Wednesday
- Leverage time zones (coordinate global supporters)
- Have assets ready: demo video, GIF, clear tagline
- Engage with every comment
- Don't expect massive user acquisition—use for credibility/press

**Realistic Expectations:**
- Good for: early adopter signups, backlinks, press coverage, credibility badge
- Not good for: mass user acquisition

## 3. Competitive Positioning

### The Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | AUM | Fee | Positioning |
|------------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Wealthfront | $4.6B+ | 0.25% | Automated investing for millennials |
| Betterment | ~$30B+ | 0.25% or $4/mo | Simple investing & financial advice |
| Empower | $10.3T (parent) | 0.89%+ | Free tools + premium wealth management |
| Vanguard Digital | $7T+ (parent) | 0.15% | Low-cost indexing |
| Robinhood | N/A | $0 trades | Active trading for everyone |
| TurboTax | N/A | $0-$129+ | DIY tax filing |

### Maven's Differentiation: AI-Native

**Against Wealthfront/Betterment:**
- They're "robo-advisors" (algorithms)
- Maven is AI-native (conversational, adaptive, learns)
- "Talk to your wealth advisor" vs. "adjust your risk tolerance slider"
- More personalized, less formulaic

**Key Messages:**
- "The first wealth platform that actually understands you"
- "AI that learns your financial life, not just your risk tolerance"
- "Your 24/7 AI wealth advisor" (vs. quarterly rebalancing)

**Against TurboTax:**
- TurboTax = point-in-time (annual tax filing)
- Maven = continuous optimization (year-round)
- "Don't wait until April to optimize your taxes"
- Proactive vs. reactive

**Against Human Advisors:**
- Same sophistication, 24/7 availability
- No minimums, no condescending meetings
- Transparent (no hidden fees/conflicts)

### Positioning Statement

**For tech-forward millennials** who want sophisticated wealth building without the complexity,
**Maven** is the AI-native wealth platform
**that** learns your entire financial picture to automatically optimize your money.
**Unlike** traditional robo-advisors that just rebalance portfolios,
**Maven** actively manages taxes, cash flow, and investments as one connected system.

### Messaging That Resonates

**Trust Signals:**
- "Sam was VP at Capital Group, managing billions"
- "Eli runs on the latest AI, trained on decades of financial expertise"
- Security/compliance credentials prominently displayed

**Emotional Hooks:**
- "Woke up to find Maven had saved me $3K in taxes while I slept" (Wealthfront's actual aha moment)
- "Finally, someone who gets my messy financial life"
- "Wealth management for people who have better things to do"

## 4. Pricing Strategy

### Competitor Pricing Reference

| Service | Pricing Model |
|---------|---------------|
| Wealthfront | 0.25% AUM annually, $500 minimum |
| Betterment | 0.25% AUM or $4/month |
| Empower (managed) | 0.89% AUM, $100K minimum |
| TurboTax Deluxe | $59-89 one-time |
| TurboTax Premier | $89-119 one-time |

### Recommended: Freemium + AUM Hybrid

**Free Tier:**
- Basic financial dashboard
- AI chat (limited queries/month)
- Educational content
- Tax projections/estimates

**Premium Tier:** $10-15/month OR 0.25% AUM (whichever is greater)
- Full AI wealth advisor
- Tax-loss harvesting
- Automated investing
- Multi-account aggregation
- Unlimited AI interactions

**Maven Pro (RIA/Advisor):** Custom pricing
- White-label or co-branded
- API access
- Client management features
- Revenue share model

### Freemium Rationale

**Why Freemium Works:**
- 83% of consumers want to test before paying
- Conversion rates typically 5-10% but high LTV
- Creates word-of-mouth at scale
- Wealthfront's referral success: 15% of invitees convert
- Need large TAM (which wealth management has)

**When to Monetize:**
- Start charging when users hit meaningful engagement (connected accounts, used AI 5+ times)
- Don't gate core value too early
- Free should be genuinely useful, not crippled

**Pricing Insight:** Wealthfront manages first $10K free, +$5K free per referral. Consider similar mechanic to reduce friction AND drive virality.

### Price Point Justification

- $10-15/month = "Netflix for your money"
- Low enough to be impulse decision
- High enough to signal value
- 0.25% AUM aligns with industry standard
- Way cheaper than human advisors (1%+)

## 5. Growth Loops

### Primary Loop: Referral Program

**Proven Mechanics in Fintech:**

| Company | Referral Reward | Result |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Wealthfront | +$5K managed free per referral | 15% invite conversion |
| Robinhood | Free stock (both parties) | 1M pre-launch waitlist |
| Revolut | Cash reward | 700% customer growth 2018-2019 |
| PayPal | $10 cash (both parties) | 10% daily growth |

**Recommended Maven Approach:**
- Double-sided reward (both referrer and referee benefit)
- Make it meaningful: "$X managed free" or "X months premium free"
- Gamification: leaderboard, tiered rewards for super-referrers
- In-app, frictionless sharing

**Sample Mechanics:**
- Refer a friend → both get 3 months premium free
- Or: Refer a friend → +$10K managed free for life
- Top 10 referrers each month get special perks

### Secondary Loop: Financial Wins → Sharing

**The "Maven saved me $X" moment:**
- When Maven finds tax savings, optimize cash, etc.
- Prompt to share: "You saved $847 this year. Share with friends who could use this."
- User-generated testimonials are most powerful

**Built-in Virality:**
- Year-end tax savings summary (shareable)
- "My 2026 money wins" recap
- AI-generated insights that feel personal

### Potential Network Effects

**Weak but Present:**
- More user data → better AI recommendations for everyone
- Not strong direct network effects like social platforms
- Focus on referral loops over network effects
