# Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)

*Research completed: 2026-02-05*

## Overview

Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) is a tax strategy for company stock held in an employer retirement plan (401k, ESOP, profit-sharing). It allows the appreciation on that stock to be taxed at long-term capital gains rates instead of ordinary income rates.

**The trade-off**: You pay some tax now (on the cost basis), but convert future ordinary income into capital gains.

## How NUA Works

### The Normal Way (Without NUA)
1. Roll 401(k) with company stock to IRA
2. Sell stock in IRA (no immediate tax)
3. Take distributions — **100% taxed as ordinary income** (up to 37%)

### The NUA Way
1. Distribute company stock **in-kind** to taxable brokerage account
2. Pay **ordinary income tax only on the cost basis** (the original purchase price)
3. When sold, the appreciation (NUA) is taxed at **long-term capital gains rates** (0%/15%/20%)

## Requirements (All Must Be Met)

### 1. Lump-Sum Distribution
- **Entire account balance** must be distributed in **one tax year**
- Includes all accounts from that employer (if multiple plans)
- You don't have to take it all as taxable — can roll some to IRA

### 2. In-Kind Distribution
- Company stock must be transferred **as shares** to a taxable brokerage account
- Cannot sell in the plan and distribute cash
- Must be actual company stock (not phantom stock, not options)

### 3. Triggering Event
Must occur after one of these:
- **Separation from service** (retirement, quit, laid off)
- **Reaching age 59½**
- **Death**
- **Disability** (self-employed only)

### 4. Employer Stock
- Must be stock of your employer (or parent/subsidiary)
- Employer stock funds qualify if they hold only company stock and cash

## Tax Treatment Summary

| Component | When Taxed | Tax Rate |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Cost Basis** | Year of distribution | Ordinary income (+ 10% penalty if under 59½) |
| **NUA (appreciation)** | When stock is sold | Long-term capital gains |
| **Post-distribution gain** | When stock is sold | STCG or LTCG based on holding period from distribution |

### Important Details
- NUA is **always** taxed as LTCG regardless of how long stock was in the plan
- NUA is **NOT** subject to 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)
- Post-distribution gains **are** subject to NIIT if applicable

## Example: NUA vs. Standard Rollover

**Scenario**:
- Company stock value: $500,000
- Cost basis: $50,000
- NUA: $450,000
- Tax bracket: 32% ordinary income, 15% LTCG

### Option A: Standard Rollover to IRA
- Roll all $500,000 to IRA
- When distributed: 100% taxed as ordinary income
- Tax on $500,000 at 32% = **$160,000**

### Option B: NUA Distribution
**At distribution**:
- Cost basis $50,000 taxed at 32% = $16,000

**When stock is sold**:
- NUA $450,000 taxed at 15% = $67,500

**Total tax** = $16,000 + $67,500 = **$83,500**

**Savings: $76,500**

## When NUA Makes Sense

### Favorable Conditions
1. **Low cost basis** (stock has appreciated significantly)
2. **Large spread** between ordinary income rate and LTCG rate
3. **Immediate or near-term sale** planned
4. **Separation from service** allowing distribution

### The Break-Even Analysis
The benefit depends on the cost basis percentage:

| Cost Basis % | Typical Break-Even |
|--------------|-------------------|
| 50%+ of value | Often NOT worth it |
| 25% of value | 13-19 years |
| 10% of value | 15-20 years |
| 1% of value | 17-27 years |

**Key insight**: If you don't plan to sell for many years, tax-deferred compounding in an IRA often wins.

## When NUA Does NOT Make Sense

1. **High cost basis** (small appreciation = small benefit)
2. **Want to hold indefinitely** (lose tax-deferred growth)
3. **Need early access** (no IRA stretch, 10% penalty on basis if under 59½)
4. **Large position would spike bracket** (undermines benefit)
5. **Expect lower tax rates in future** (better to defer)
6. **Planning for step-up** (but NUA doesn't get step-up at death!)

### Critical: NUA Does NOT Get Step-Up at Death
- Per Revenue Ruling 75-125, NUA is "Income in Respect of a Decedent"
- Your heirs will pay LTCG tax on the NUA when they sell
- Only post-distribution appreciation gets stepped up

## Cherry-Picking Shares

You can be selective:
- Take low-basis shares as NUA distribution
- Roll high-basis shares to IRA
- **Must still distribute entire account** in same tax year

### Example
- $200,000 total company stock
- $100,000 (Lot A): $5,000 basis — use NUA
- $100,000 (Lot B): $80,000 basis — roll to IRA

This maximizes NUA benefit while minimizing immediate ordinary income.

## Early Withdrawal Penalty

If under 59½ at distribution:
- **10% penalty applies to cost basis** (not NUA)
- May still be worth it if cost basis is very low

### Example
- Stock value: $500,000
- Cost basis: $25,000 (5% of value)
- 10% penalty on $25,000 = $2,500 (only 0.5% of total value)

For someone at 54 who wants to diversify, $2,500 may be acceptable to access $500,000 of stock with favorable tax treatment.

## Holding After Distribution

### Option 1: Sell Immediately
- Recognize NUA gain at LTCG rates
- Diversify proceeds
- Most common approach

### Option 2: Hold the Stock
- NUA gain deferred until sale
- Post-distribution gains accrue (STCG/LTCG based on holding period from distribution)
- Can use securities-based lending for liquidity
- Risk: concentrated position, stock could decline

### Option 3: Donate to Charity
- Avoid NUA tax entirely
- Get charitable deduction for FMV
- Best for philanthropic clients with large NUA

## Timing Considerations

### First Distribution After Triggering Event
**Critical**: The NUA election must be made for a **lump-sum distribution** that occurs in the same tax year as your **first distribution** after a triggering event.

**Mistake to avoid**:
- Retire in 2025 (triggering event)
- Take partial distribution in 2025 (even small amount)
- Try to do NUA in 2026 — **TOO LATE**

The 2025 distribution wasn't a lump-sum, so you've lost NUA eligibility until the next triggering event (e.g., age 59½).

### Solution
Wait for next triggering event (age 59½ if you already separated from service).

## Decision Framework

### Do NUA Analysis When:
- [ ] Significant company stock in 401(k)/ESOP
- [ ] Experiencing or approaching a triggering event
- [ ] Cost basis is relatively low (<25% of current value)
- [ ] Spread between ordinary income and LTCG rates is meaningful

### Calculate:
1. Total value of company stock
2. Cost basis (get from plan administrator)
3. Tax on basis at ordinary income rates
4. Tax on NUA at LTCG rates
5. Compare total NUA tax to: Rollover and eventual ordinary income tax
6. Factor in time value of deferral

### Proceed with NUA When:
- Cost basis is low enough to justify immediate tax
- You plan to sell/diversify relatively soon
- You don't expect to be in a much lower bracket later
- The math clearly favors NUA

## Reporting

- Plan administrator reports NUA in **Box 6** of Form 1099-R
- Cost basis goes in Box 2a as taxable amount
- When you sell, report NUA portion as LTCG on Schedule D

## Key Takeaways

1. **NUA converts ordinary income to LTCG** on company stock appreciation
2. **Requirements are strict** — lump-sum, in-kind, after triggering event
3. **Low cost basis = bigger benefit** — high basis may not be worth it
4. **First distribution after trigger** determines eligibility window
5. **Cherry-pick low-basis lots** if you have mixed cost basis shares
6. **No step-up at death** for NUA — heirs pay LTCG
7. **Run the numbers** — the benefit depends heavily on specific circumstances
