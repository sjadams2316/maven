# Roth Conversion Strategies

*Research completed: 2026-02-05*

## Overview

A Roth conversion moves money from a pre-tax account (Traditional IRA, 401k) to a Roth IRA. You pay ordinary income tax now in exchange for tax-free growth and withdrawals later. The key question: **Is it better to pay taxes now or later?**

## Basic Mechanics

1. **Convert** funds from Traditional IRA/401k to Roth IRA
2. **Pay income tax** on the converted amount in the current year
3. **Enjoy tax-free growth** and qualified withdrawals going forward

## When to Convert (Tax Bracket Arbitrage)

### The Core Principle
Convert when your current tax rate is **lower** than your expected future tax rate.

### Common Low-Tax Opportunities

1. **Income Gap Years**
   - After retirement but before Social Security/pensions begin
   - After leaving a job but before starting a new one
   - Sabbatical or career break years

2. **Market Downturns**
   - Convert depressed assets = less taxable income
   - If market recovers, growth is tax-free in Roth

3. **Low Income Years**
   - Graduate school, starting a business
   - Part-time work years

4. **Before RMDs Begin**
   - Ages 59½ to 73 are often ideal conversion years
   - Once RMDs start, you can't convert RMD amounts

5. **Early Retirement**
   - Bridge years between early retirement and age 73
   - Often the best opportunity for systematic conversions

## Partial Conversions (Bracket Filling)

### Strategy
Convert just enough to "fill up" a favorable tax bracket without spilling into the next.

### Example: 2025 Tax Brackets (Married Filing Jointly)
| Bracket | Income Range |
|---------|-------------|
| 10% | $0 - $23,850 |
| 12% | $23,850 - $96,950 |
| 22% | $96,950 - $206,700 |
| 24% | $206,700 - $394,600 |
| 32% | $394,600 - $501,050 |
| 35% | $501,050 - $751,600 |
| 37% | $751,600+ |

**If other income is $80,000:**
- Space in 12% bracket: $96,950 - $80,000 = $16,950
- Convert $16,950 at 12% marginal rate
- Alternative: Fill 22% bracket = convert additional $109,750

### Multi-Year Conversion Ladder
Convert systematically each year:
- Year 1: Fill 22% bracket
- Year 2: Fill 22% bracket
- Year 3: Fill 22% bracket
- Continue until Traditional IRA depleted or circumstances change

## The Pro-Rata Rule

**This is critical and often misunderstood.**

### How It Works
When you convert from a Traditional IRA (or take any distribution), the IRS treats **all your Traditional IRAs as one pool**. You can't cherry-pick just the after-tax (non-deductible) portion.

### The Formula
**Taxable % = Total Pre-Tax Balance ÷ Total IRA Balance × 100**

### Example
- Traditional IRA #1: $85,000 (all pre-tax)
- Traditional IRA #2: $15,000 (all non-deductible contributions)
- **Total**: $100,000 (85% pre-tax, 15% after-tax)

If you convert $10,000:
- $8,500 is taxable (85%)
- $1,500 is tax-free (15%)

**You cannot just convert IRA #2 tax-free** — the pro-rata rule applies to all your Traditional IRA money combined.

### Accounts Included in Pro-Rata Calculation
- Traditional IRAs
- SEP IRAs
- SIMPLE IRAs (after 2-year participation requirement)

### Accounts NOT Included
- 401(k), 403(b), 457(b) plans (while employed)
- Inherited IRAs
- Roth IRAs

### Backdoor Roth Strategy
High earners who can't contribute directly to Roth IRA:
1. Make non-deductible Traditional IRA contribution
2. Convert to Roth IRA

**Problem**: If you have other pre-tax IRA money, pro-rata rule makes this partially taxable.

**Solutions**:
1. Roll pre-tax IRA money into 401(k) (if plan accepts)
2. Convert all pre-tax money first (pay the tax)
3. Accept partial taxation

## The Five-Year Rules

**There are multiple 5-year rules. Don't confuse them.**

### Rule 1: 5-Year Rule for Roth IRA Earnings
- **Applies to**: Withdrawing earnings tax-free
- **Clock starts**: January 1 of the year of your first Roth contribution/conversion
- **Once satisfied**: Applies to all future Roth IRAs
- **Requirement**: Must also be 59½ to withdraw earnings tax-free

### Rule 2: 5-Year Rule for Conversions
- **Applies to**: Avoiding 10% penalty on converted amounts (if under 59½)
- **Clock starts**: January 1 of year of EACH conversion
- **Key point**: Each conversion has its OWN 5-year clock
- **After 59½**: This rule doesn't matter — no penalty anyway

### Ordering Rules for Roth Distributions
IRS assumes withdrawals come out in this order:
1. **Regular contributions** (always tax and penalty-free)
2. **Converted amounts** (FIFO — oldest conversions first)
3. **Earnings** (tax/penalty-free only if qualified)

### Practical Implications

**Example**: You're 57, did a $50,000 conversion this year.
- At 58, you want $10,000
- Taking from conversion amount triggers 10% penalty ($1,000)
- At 62 (5 years later), same withdrawal = no penalty

**But**: If you'd had a Roth IRA since age 45 with regular contributions:
- Those contributions come out first, penalty-free
- Only when you've exhausted contributions do you tap conversions

## Special Situations

### Backdoor Roth IRA
For high earners above Roth IRA income limits:
1. Contribute to non-deductible Traditional IRA ($7,000 for 2025, $8,000 if 50+)
2. Convert to Roth IRA (immediately or shortly after)
3. Minimal taxable income if converted quickly before growth

**Key requirements**:
- Must not have significant pre-tax IRA balances (pro-rata)
- Must have earned income to contribute

### Mega Backdoor Roth
If 401(k) plan allows:
1. Max out pre-tax 401(k) contribution ($23,500 for 2025)
2. Make after-tax contributions up to total 415 limit ($70,000 for 2025)
3. Convert after-tax portion to Roth (in-plan or roll to Roth IRA)

**Potential annual Roth contribution**: $70,000 - $23,500 = $46,500 beyond normal limits

### Recharacterization Note
**As of 2018, Roth conversions can NO LONGER be recharacterized (undone).**

Once you convert, it's permanent. Plan carefully.

## Conversion Modeling Factors

### Variables to Consider
1. **Current marginal tax rate**
2. **Expected future marginal tax rate**
3. **Source of funds for tax payment** (pay from outside, not from conversion)
4. **Time until withdrawal**
5. **State income tax (now vs retirement state)**
6. **Impact on ACA premium subsidies**
7. **Impact on Medicare IRMAA (2 years later)**
8. **Estate planning goals**

### Impact on Other Income-Based Calculations
Conversion increases AGI, which can affect:
- ACA premium tax credits (significant cliff effects)
- Medicare Part B/D premiums (IRMAA surcharges)
- Taxation of Social Security benefits
- Net Investment Income Tax (3.8% on high earners)
- State-specific benefits tied to income

## Decision Framework

### Convert MORE When:
- [ ] Current tax bracket significantly lower than expected future bracket
- [ ] In "income gap" years (early retirement, sabbatical)
- [ ] Market is down (convert same shares for less tax)
- [ ] Expect tax rates to rise (TCJA expires 2026)
- [ ] Have funds outside IRA to pay conversion tax
- [ ] Long time until needed (more compounding)
- [ ] Want to reduce future RMDs
- [ ] Estate planning: leave tax-free assets to heirs

### Convert LESS (or Not at All) When:
- [ ] Current tax bracket same or higher than expected
- [ ] Would push into higher bracket beyond target
- [ ] Would trigger ACA cliff or IRMAA
- [ ] Must pay tax from the converted funds themselves
- [ ] Need the money within 5 years (if under 59½)
- [ ] Already have adequate Roth assets

## Common Mistakes

1. **Converting too much** — pushing into higher brackets
2. **Ignoring pro-rata rule** — surprise tax bill
3. **Paying tax from converted funds** — reduces effective conversion
4. **Forgetting state taxes** — can be 5-13%+ additional
5. **Triggering IRMAA** — Medicare surcharges hit 2 years later
6. **Converting RMD amounts** — not allowed
7. **Not considering 5-year rules** — penalties if early access needed

## Modeling Example

**Scenario**: Married couple, age 62, retired
- Traditional IRA: $1,500,000
- Taxable accounts: $500,000
- Social Security (starting at 67): $40,000/year combined
- No pension
- Current spending: $80,000/year

**Analysis**:
- Ages 62-67: Low income years (ideal for conversion)
- Fill 22% bracket: ~$206,700 - ~$30,000 standard deduction = room for ~$176,700
- With $80,000 spending from taxable accounts, can convert ~$100,000+ annually
- Goal: Reduce IRA to minimize future RMDs and tax impact
