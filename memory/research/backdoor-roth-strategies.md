*Research compiled: 2026-02-05*

## The Alpha Most Advisors Miss

Most advisors know about the backdoor Roth. Few explain it correctly. Here's what actually matters.

## Part 1: Backdoor Roth IRA

### What It Actually Is
A backdoor Roth is **not an account** — it's a two-step process:
1. Contribute to a Traditional IRA (non-deductible)
2. Convert that Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA

This bypasses the income limits that prevent direct Roth IRA contributions.

### 2025-2026 Numbers
- **IRA Contribution Limit:** $7,000 ($8,000 if 50+)
- **Roth MAGI Phaseout (MFJ):** $230,000-$240,000 (2024)
- **Roth MAGI Phaseout (Single):** $146,000-$161,000 (2024)

### The Pro-Rata Rule: Where 90% of Mistakes Happen

**The Rule:** The IRS treats ALL your Traditional IRAs as one pool for conversion purposes. You can't cherry-pick which dollars to convert.

**Accounts that count:**
- Traditional IRA
- Rollover IRA
- SEP IRA
- SIMPLE IRA

**Accounts that DON'T count:**
- 401(k), 403(b), 457(b)
- Roth IRA
- Inherited IRA (most cases)
- **Spouse's IRAs** (calculated separately)

### The Math That Ruins Everything

**Example:** You have a $93,000 Rollover IRA (pre-tax) and contribute $7,000 to a new Traditional IRA (after-tax). Total: $100,000.

You think: "I'll just convert my $7,000 after-tax contribution."

The IRS says: Only 7% of your conversion is tax-free. 93% is taxable.

**Result:** Convert $7,000 → $6,510 is taxable income → ~$2,000+ in unexpected taxes.

### December 31 Trap
The pro-rata calculation uses your **December 31 balance** of the year you convert. Even if you contribute in January and convert in February, if you have pre-tax IRAs on December 31 of that year, you're trapped.

**Implication:** To do a clean backdoor Roth in 2026, clear your pre-tax IRAs by December 31, 2026.

## The Fix: Roll Pre-Tax IRAs to 401(k)

401(k) balances are **excluded** from pro-rata calculation.

**Before:** $93,000 rollover IRA + $7,000 new contribution = 93% taxable
**Action:** Roll $93,000 into solo 401(k) or employer 401(k)
**After:** $0 pre-tax IRA + $7,000 new contribution = 0% taxable

**Business owners advantage:** If you control your own 401(k) (solo 401k, small business 401k), you can solve this problem completely.

**W-2 employee trap:** If your employer's 401(k) doesn't accept IRA rollovers, you're stuck.

### Other Options
1. **Convert everything** — Pay tax now, clean slate going forward
2. **Wait** — Don't force a backdoor Roth with bad pro-rata math
3. **Accept the math** — Sometimes partial taxation is worth it for decades of tax-free growth

## Part 2: Mega Backdoor Roth

### What It Is
A mega backdoor Roth uses your **401(k)** (not IRA) to get dramatically more money into Roth accounts.

**Process:**
1. Make after-tax contributions to your 401(k) (separate from pre-tax and Roth 401(k) contributions)
2. Convert those after-tax contributions to Roth (either in-plan conversion or in-service distribution to Roth IRA)

### 2025-2026 Limits

| Limit Type | Under 50 | Age 50+ | Ages 60-63 |
|------------|----------|---------|------------|
| **2026 Employee Deferral** | $24,500 | $32,500 | $35,750 |
| **2025 Employee Deferral** | $23,500 | $31,000 | $34,750 |
| **2026 Total (415c)** | $72,000 | $72,000 | $72,000 |
| **2025 Total (415c)** | $70,000 | $70,000 | $70,000 |

**The Math:**
- 2025: You max pre-tax at $23,500. Employer contributes $10,000. You can add up to **$36,500** in after-tax contributions ($70,000 - $23,500 - $10,000).
- That's $36,500 → Roth via mega backdoor, on top of your regular backdoor Roth IRA.

### Plan Requirements (Critical)
Your 401(k) must allow:
1. **After-tax contributions** (different from pre-tax and Roth 401(k))
2. **Either:**
   - In-plan Roth conversions, OR
   - In-service distributions (withdrawals while still employed)

**Check your Summary Plan Description.** Many plans don't allow this.

### Timing Matters
Convert after-tax contributions **immediately** if your plan allows. Any earnings on after-tax contributions are taxable when converted.

## Implementation Checklist

### Backdoor Roth
- [ ] Check December 31 balance of ALL IRAs
- [ ] Roll any pre-tax IRAs to 401(k) before year-end
- [ ] Contribute $7,000 (or $8,000 if 50+) to Traditional IRA
- [ ] Convert to Roth immediately (same day if possible)
- [ ] File Form 8606 with your tax return (one per spouse)

### Mega Backdoor Roth
- [ ] Confirm your plan allows after-tax contributions
- [ ] Confirm in-plan conversion or in-service distribution
- [ ] Calculate available space: $70,000 - employee deferrals - employer match
- [ ] Set up after-tax contributions
- [ ] Convert immediately and frequently (minimize taxable earnings)

## Mind-Blowing Fact for Clients

> "A married couple doing both strategies can potentially move **$86,000+** into Roth accounts annually: $14,000 (backdoor Roth × 2) + $72,000 (mega backdoor for one spouse). Over 20 years at 7% growth, that's **$3.7 million** in tax-free money."

---

## Common Mistakes
1. Forgetting about old rollover IRAs (pro-rata trap)
2. Not converting immediately (taxable earnings)
3. Missing December 31 deadline for IRA cleanup
4. Assuming all 401(k)s allow mega backdoor
5. Filing Form 8606 incorrectly
6. Forgetting spousal backdoor Roth (each spouse files separate 8606)
