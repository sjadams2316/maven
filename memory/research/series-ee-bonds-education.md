# Series EE Bonds for Education: The Forgotten Strategy
*Research compiled: 2026-02-05*

## The Alpha Most Advisors Miss

Series EE bonds can be cashed **completely tax-free** for education expenses. Most advisors have never heard of this. It's been in the tax code since 1990.

---

## How It Works

### The Tax Exclusion
When you cash EE or I bonds for qualified higher education expenses, the interest can be excluded from gross income entirely.

This is **not** a deduction. The interest simply isn't taxable.

### Requirements (All Must Be Met)
1. **Age requirement:** Bond owner must be 24+ years old at time of purchase
2. **Bond type:** Series EE or I bonds issued after 1989
3. **Registration:** Bonds must be in your name (or joint with spouse)
4. **Income limits:** MAGI below threshold in redemption year
5. **Timing:** Redeem and pay expenses in same tax year
6. **Expenses:** Qualified higher education at eligible institution
7. **Filing status:** Cannot file Married Filing Separately

## 2025 Income Limits

| Filing Status | Phaseout Begins | Phaseout Ends |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Single/HoH | $99,500 | $114,500 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $149,250 | $179,250 |
| Married Filing Separately | **Ineligible** | — |

**The Trap:** These are limits in the year you CASH the bonds, not when you buy them.

A high earner today might have low income when the child goes to college (retired, sabbatical, etc.).

## EE Bonds: The Unique Guarantee

### EE Bond vs I Bond for Education

| Feature | EE Bond | I Bond |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Interest rate** | Fixed (currently ~2.7%) | Inflation-adjusted |
| **20-year guarantee** | **Doubles in value** | No guarantee |
| **Education exclusion** | Yes | Yes |
| **Purchase limit** | $10,000/year | $10,000/year |

### The 20-Year Doubling
EE bonds are guaranteed to double in value after 20 years.

**The Math:**
- Buy $10,000 EE bond today
- After 20 years: Guaranteed $20,000
- Effective yield: 3.5% annually (regardless of stated rate)

**Implication:** For 20+ year horizon, EE bonds offer a guaranteed 3.5% return. If stated rate is lower, Treasury makes a one-time adjustment at year 20.

---

## Qualified Expenses

✅ **Included:**
- Tuition and fees at eligible institutions
- Contributions to 529 plans
- Contributions to Coverdell ESA

❌ **Not Included:**
- Room and board
- Books and supplies
- Transportation

**Key Difference from 529:** 529 covers room/board. EE education exclusion does not.

---

## Eligible Institutions

Any accredited college, university, vocational school, or other postsecondary institution eligible to participate in federal student aid programs.

Includes:
- 4-year universities
- Community colleges
- Trade schools
- Graduate programs
- Professional schools

## The Child Registration Trap

**Critical Error:** Buying bonds in child's name for child's education.

**Why It Fails:** The owner must be 24+ at time of purchase. A 10-year-old cannot own bonds that qualify for this exclusion.

**Correct Approach:**
1. Parent buys bonds (registered as owner or co-owner with spouse)
2. Child can be beneficiary (not owner)
3. When child goes to college, parent cashes bonds and pays expenses

---

## Strategy: EE Bonds vs 529

### When to Use 529
- Income likely to be HIGH when child starts college
- Want to cover room/board, books, supplies
- State tax deduction available
- Want investment growth potential

### When to Use EE Bonds
- Income likely to be LOW when child starts college (retirement, job change)
- Only need to cover tuition/fees
- Want guaranteed return (no market risk)
- Already maxing 529 or want diversification

### The Hybrid Approach
- 529 for broader expenses and growth
- EE bonds for guaranteed portion of tuition
- Cash EE bonds first if income qualifies, 529 for remainder

---

## The 529 Conversion Play

**Qualified education expenses include contributions to 529 plans.**

**Strategy:**
1. Cash EE bonds
2. Contribute proceeds to 529 plan
3. Bond interest is tax-free
4. 529 funds grow tax-free
5. Use 529 for broader expenses (including room/board)

**When to Use:** If your expenses are smaller than your bond redemption, or you want to "convert" the tax-free interest into 529 flexibility.

---

## Filing Requirements

### Form 8815
File with your tax return to claim the exclusion.

**Information Needed:**
- Bond serial numbers
- Face value
- Issue dates
- Redemption amounts
- Qualified expenses paid

### Record Keeping
Maintain:
- Bond purchase confirmations
- Redemption statements
- Tuition bills and payment receipts
- Scholarship/grant documentation (reduces qualified expenses)

---

## The Scholarship Reduction

If the student receives tax-free scholarships or grants, qualified expenses are reduced by that amount.

**Example:**
- Tuition: $50,000
- Scholarship: $30,000
- Qualified expenses for EE exclusion: $20,000

If you cash $40,000 in bonds, only $20,000 of interest can be excluded (proportionally).

## Mind-Blowing Facts for Clients

> "A couple earning $140,000 can cash $100,000 in EE bonds and pay zero tax on the $50,000 in interest if it goes to college tuition. That's $50,000 in tax-free income. Try doing that with a regular investment account."

> "EE bonds are guaranteed to double in 20 years regardless of the stated rate. That's a 3.5% guaranteed return backed by the US Treasury. For risk-free education savings on a 20-year horizon, it's hard to beat."

## When This Strategy Shines

1. **Pre-retirement parents** buying bonds that mature when income drops
2. **Grandparents** with moderate income buying for grandchildren
3. **Anyone planning income volatility** around college years
4. **Risk-averse savers** who want guarantees over growth
5. **Families already maxing 529s** looking for additional tax-advantaged education savings
