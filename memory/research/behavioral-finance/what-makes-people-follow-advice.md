# What Makes People Follow Financial Advice?
## Behavioral Finance Research for Maven Wealth Platform

*Research compiled: 2026-02-06*

> "Building features people use is as important as building the right features."

---

## Executive Summary

People consistently fail to act on financial advice they know is good—the **intention-action gap** is one of the most robust findings in behavioral finance. This gap arises from predictable cognitive biases: loss aversion, present bias, mental accounting quirks, and overconfidence. The good news? Behavioral interventions that work *with* these biases—rather than fighting them—can dramatically improve outcomes. Maven's opportunity lies in designing UX that makes the right choice the easy choice.

**Key insight**: Don't try to fix human psychology. Design around it.

## 1. The Intention-Action Gap: Why People Don't Follow Advice

### The Core Problem
People have good intentions but fail to act on them. This is **the** central challenge of financial wellness apps.

**Why the gap exists:**
- Financial decisions involve trade-offs between **present** and **future** selves
- The present demands attention; the future is abstract
- We battle temptation and lack of self-control
- Knowing what to do ≠ being able to do it

> "Although people may have good intentions and often have their own (and others') best interests at heart, there is a mismatch between intentions and action." — Prof. Hal Hershfield, UCLA

### The "Knowing-Doing Gap"
Even finance professionals exhibit this gap. Research shows three forms of resistance:
1. **Acceptance resistance**: Still believing in the rational agent model
2. **Awareness without action**: Understanding biases but not applying solutions
3. **Outward focus**: Analyzing others' sentiment instead of one's own behavior

**The standard change model is broken:**
- Clear goal + action plan + monitoring + willpower = change
- This fails because we **cannot** consistently apply willpower
- We cannot simply switch from problematic to desired behavior

### What Actually Drives Change
The key is **choice architecture**, not willpower:
- "Want to" goals are more achievable than "have to" goals
- Structure your environment to avoid self-control decisions entirely
- Make the right behavior the default behavior

**Critical insight**: Financial stress reduces ability to comprehend advice AND reduces intention to change (Grable & Britt research). Help users feel in control first.

## 2. Loss Aversion and Its Impact on Investing

### The Science
Loss aversion is the finding that **losses hurt about twice as much as equivalent gains feel good** (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).

- Lose $100: Pain level = ~200 "utils"
- Gain $100: Pleasure level = ~100 "utils"
- This asymmetry is baked into our neural architecture

### How It Hurts Investors

**Behavioral patterns:**
- **Selling winners too early**: Locking in gains to avoid potential loss
- **Holding losers too long**: Refusing to realize a loss (disposition effect)
- **Excessive conservatism**: Keeping too much in cash to avoid any loss
- **Panic selling**: Exiting during market downturns at the worst time
- **Loss chasing**: Taking more risk after losses to "get back to even"

**Market sensitivity pattern:**
People are more sensitive to stock market fluctuations than to changes in labor income or housing wealth—even though the latter often matter more to actual wealth.

### Implications for Maven

**Don't do this:**
- Show daily portfolio changes prominently
- Frame contributions as money "leaving" their account
- Emphasize losses in any communication

**Do this instead:**
- Frame investing as building something (gains frame)
- Show long-term progress, not daily fluctuations  
- Aggregate losses (show weekly/monthly, not daily when markets are down)
- Frame not-investing as a loss ("missing out on potential growth")
- Use visualizations that de-emphasize volatility

## 3. Present Bias and Saving Behavior

### The Science: Hyperbolic Discounting
People prefer immediate rewards over larger future rewards, even when it's irrational.

**Classic example:**
- Choose: $100 today vs $110 tomorrow → Most choose $100 today
- Choose: $100 in one year vs $110 in one year + 1 day → Most choose $110

Same time delay, different choice. This is **present bias**—we systematically overweight the immediate present.

### Why This Devastates Savings

Saving requires sacrificing present consumption for future benefit. Every behavioral instinct works against this:
- Immediate gratification is hardwired
- Future self feels like a stranger
- Abstract future benefits can't compete with concrete present costs
- The market is designed to exploit present bias (fast fashion, BNPL, etc.)

### What Works

**Make future self less abstract:**
- Age-progressed photos of users increased savings in experiments (Hershfield)
- Concrete future scenarios beat abstract numbers
- BUT: This works best for "single-shot" decisions, not repeated ones

**Reduce decision points:**
- Automatic savings eliminate repeated decisions
- Each decision point is an opportunity for present bias to win
- "Set and forget" > constant engagement for savings goals

**Front-load the commitment:**
- People commit more easily when the sacrifice is in the future
- "Starting next month" > "starting today"
- This is the insight behind **Save More Tomorrow**

## 4. Mental Accounting: How It Helps and Hurts

### The Science
People mentally separate money into different "accounts" based on source, timing, and intended use—even though money is fungible (Richard Thaler).

**Examples:**
- Tax refund = "windfall" → spent differently than salary
- Small inheritance → spent; large inheritance → invested
- "Fun money" vs "bill money" vs "savings"

### How It Hurts

**The fungibility blindspot:**
- Keeping high-interest debt while holding savings (different "accounts")
- Treating investment gains as "house money" to gamble with
- Refusing to spend from certain accounts even when optimal

**Narrow framing:**
- Evaluating each investment in isolation vs. portfolio context
- Not seeing full financial picture across accounts

### How It Helps

Mental accounting can be **leveraged** for good:
- Earmarking money as "savings" changes behavior toward it
- Goal-specific accounts increase commitment
- Visible "buckets" make progress tangible

### Implications for Maven

**Use mental accounting strategically:**
- Create clear visual "buckets" for different goals
- Name accounts emotionally ("Dream Vacation Fund" > "Savings Account 2")
- Show money earmarked for investing as already "gone" from spending

**Combat harmful mental accounting:**
- Show whole-portfolio view as the default
- Integrate all accounts into one dashboard
- Educate on debt payoff vs. savings math

## 5. Overconfidence and Trading

### The Science
People systematically overestimate their knowledge, abilities, and precision of beliefs. This manifests as:
- **Overprecision**: Too certain in our estimates
- **Overplacement**: Believing we're above average
- **Overestimation**: Thinking we can control outcomes we can't

### The Cost to Investors

**Research findings (Barber & Odean, Daniel & Hirshleifer):**
- Overconfident investors trade more
- More trading = worse returns (due to costs and poor timing)
- Men trade 45% more than women, earning 1% less annually
- Past success increases overconfidence → more aggressive behavior → eventual losses

**Pattern:**
- Bull markets breed overconfidence
- Overconfidence persists more in **low-return** environments (seeking higher returns)
- Experience doesn't fix it—often makes it worse

### Implications for Maven

**Don't feed overconfidence:**
- Avoid gamification that rewards trading activity
- Don't celebrate individual stock picks
- Frame success as "good behavior" not "smart choices"

**Design for humility:**
- Show how index funds outperform most active traders
- Provide context for any "successful" trades (was it luck?)
- Default to diversified, passive strategies
- Make active trading require deliberate friction

## 6. What Actually Works to Change Behavior

### 1. Defaults (Auto-Enrollment)

**The gold standard intervention.**

**Evidence:**
- Auto-enrollment increases 401(k) participation from **42% to 91%** (Thaler research)
- Effect is much larger than employer matching contributions
- People stick with default rates whether 3% or 6%
- Vanguard: Auto-enrollment **triples** participation among new hires

**Why it works:**
- Removes the decision entirely
- Inertia works FOR saving instead of AGAINST it
- No willpower required

**Caveats:**
- Long-term effect smaller than first-year effect (1.5-0.6pp vs 2.2pp)
- Some people opt out eventually
- Higher cash-out rates for auto-enrolled (smaller balances)

**Still the most effective intervention we have.**

### 2. Save More Tomorrow (SMarT)

**Concept**: Commit now to increase savings rate when future raises occur.

**Why it works:**
- Commitment happens in the present (easy)
- Sacrifice happens in the future (less painful)
- Loss aversion neutralized—you never "lose" current income
- Present bias exploited—future commitment feels cheap

**Results:**
- Participants **tripled** their savings rate in 28 months
- 15+ million Americans have used SMarT-style programs
- Now required in new 401(k) plans under SECURE 2.0

### 3. Commitment Devices

**Definition**: Tools that lock in intended behavior, making deviation costly.

**Effective mechanisms:**
- **Illiquidity**: Can't access funds easily (works for savings)
- **Social commitment**: Telling others about goals
- **Financial penalties**: Losing money for breaking commitment
- **Cooling-off periods**: Time delay before reversing decisions

**Evidence:**
- Filipino banking customers increased savings 81% with commitment savings accounts
- stickK.com shows commitment contracts increase goal completion 40%

**Key insight**: Effective commitment devices work *below awareness*—they don't require constant vigilance.

### 4. Simplification

**Complexity is the enemy of action.**

**What works:**
- Simplified enrollment forms significantly increase participation
- Pre-selected defaults beat choice menus
- Fewer options = more decisions made
- One-click actions beat multi-step processes

**Friction in the right direction:**
- Make saving frictionless
- Make spending/withdrawing slightly harder
- "Cool down" periods before large withdrawals

### 5. Social Proof (Use With Caution!)

**The research is mixed:**

**Positive findings:**
- Peer comparison can motivate savings ("76% of people your age are saving")
- Social norms provide anchors for behavior
- Information about peers increases enrollment conversations

**Surprising negative findings:**
- A landmark 401(k) study found peer information **decreased** enrollment among some groups by 1/3
- Effect: Seeing high peer savings rates **discouraged** low savers
- "Upward social comparisons" can backfire

**When it works:**
- When user is close to the norm (achievable)
- When framed as "join the majority" not "catch up"
- Combined with easy action steps

**When it backfires:**
- When the gap feels insurmountable
- When it triggers feelings of inadequacy
- Among completely passive users (those most needing help!)

### 6. Reminders & Salience

**Simple but effective:**
- SMS reminders increase savings (but cultural context matters)
- Physical piggy banks / saving jars work via visibility
- Progress visualizations maintain motivation

**Habituation risk**: People start ignoring repeated interventions. Vary timing and message.

## 7. Successful Fintech Examples

### Acorns

**Model**: Round-ups + automatic investing

**Behavioral insights used:**
- **Mental accounting**: "Spare change" feels painless to invest
- **Automation**: Removes decision fatigue
- **Simplification**: Pre-built portfolios, no decisions required
- **Low barrier**: Starts with pennies, builds habit

**Results:**
- 10+ million users
- Particularly effective for people who "find it hard to save"
- Advisory board led by behavioral economist Shlomo Benartzi (Save More Tomorrow co-creator)

**Recent evolution:**
- "Money Manager" feature puts saving/investing as budget line items
- AI assistant evolving toward full financial advisor

### Digit (now part of Oportun)

**Model**: AI analyzes spending patterns, automatically saves "safe" amounts

**Behavioral insights:**
- **Removes decision entirely**: AI decides when/how much to save
- **Loss aversion mitigated**: Only saves what you "won't miss"
- **Present bias bypassed**: No sacrifice feels required

### Qapital

**Model**: Rule-based automatic savings tied to triggers

**Behavioral insights:**
- **If-then rules**: "If I buy coffee, save $2"
- **Goal visualization**: Named goals with images
- **Gamification**: Spending becomes saving opportunity

### Common Success Patterns

1. **Automation is king**: Every successful app removes manual decisions
2. **Small starts**: Begin with amounts that feel invisible
3. **Visual progress**: Show growth toward goals
4. **Behavioral science teams**: Acorns has dedicated "Money Lab"
5. **Reduce choice**: Pre-built options beat customization

## 8. How Maven Should Use These Insights

### UX Design Principles

#### Make the Right Thing the Default
- **Auto-enrollment** into recommended strategies
- **Auto-escalation** when income increases (detect raises?)
- **Auto-rebalancing** at sensible intervals
- Pre-selected portfolios based on goals/timeline

#### Remove Friction from Good Behavior
- One-tap enrollment
- Recurring investments set up in 30 seconds
- No "are you sure?" for saving (only for withdrawing)
- Link bank accounts with instant verification

#### Add Friction to Bad Behavior
- Cooling-off period before large withdrawals
- Multi-step process for panic-selling
- Show opportunity cost of early withdrawal
- "Are you sure?" confirmations for behavior that hurts goals

#### Frame Everything as Gains
- "You've grown $X" not "Your portfolio changed by"
- "You're $X closer to your goal" not "You still need $X"
- Contribution = "building" not "paying" or "spending"
- Focus on shares owned, not just dollar value (shares don't go down in crash)

### Communication Strategy

#### Reduce Financial Stress First
- Lead with reassurance, not alarm
- Celebrate small wins before pushing for more
- Avoid comparisons that trigger inadequacy
- Use empathy language ("We know saving is hard")

#### Make Future Tangible
- Name goals concretely ("Your 2030 Home Down Payment")
- Show future scenarios, not just numbers
- Consider age-progression or lifestyle imagery
- Countdown to goals, not just "% complete"

#### Social Proof Guidelines
- Use only when user is close to norm
- Frame as "join the majority" not "catch up"
- Avoid showing how far behind someone is
- Consider hiding peer comparisons for users showing signs of discouragement
- Test carefully—can backfire!

### Feature Ideas

1. **"Future Me" Onboarding**: Help users visualize their future self/lifestyle before showing products

2. **Commitment Calendar**: Users commit to a savings increase 60 days out; option to "keep my promise" reminder

3. **Round-Up Plus**: Classic round-ups, but with "boost" multipliers user can set (2x, 3x)

4. **Wealth Snapshot**: Single dashboard across all accounts showing true net worth

5. **Goal Buckets**: Named, visualized savings buckets with emotional labels

6. **Smart Friction**: Variable confirmation steps based on whether action helps or hurts goals

7. **Progress Celebrations**: Milestone notifications that feel like achievements

8. **Calm Mode**: Option to hide daily/weekly fluctuations during volatile markets

### Metrics to Track

**Behavioral KPIs (not just financial):**
- Auto-enrollment opt-out rate
- Time from signup to first investment
- Auto-escalation acceptance rate
- Withdrawal "cooling off" completion (did they still withdraw after delay?)
- Login frequency during market downturns (high = panic, bad sign)
- Goal completion rates by goal naming style

2. **Defaults are the most powerful tool**—auto-enroll, auto-escalate, auto-invest
3. **Loss aversion is 2x stronger than gain-seeking**—frame everything as building, not losing
4. **Present bias defeats willpower**—use commitment devices and future-dated choices
5. **Mental accounting can be leveraged**—create emotional goal buckets
6. **Overconfidence destroys returns**—discourage active trading
7. **Simplification beats education**—one-click > explained choices
8. **Social proof can backfire**—test carefully with discouraged users
9. **Reduce stress first**—anxious users can't process advice
10. **Automate everything**—the best decision is no decision
