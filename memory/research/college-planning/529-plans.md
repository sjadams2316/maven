# 529 Plans Deep Dive

*Research completed: 2026-02-05*

## Overview

529 plans are tax-advantaged education savings accounts. Money grows tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified education expenses are also tax-free. The 2022 SECURE 2.0 Act added the ability to roll over unused 529 funds to a Roth IRA.

## Types of 529 Plans

### 1. Education Savings Plans (Most Common)
- Investment accounts similar to 401(k)/IRA
- You choose from plan's investment options
- Account value fluctuates with market
- Can be used at any accredited institution

### 2. Prepaid Tuition Plans
- Lock in current tuition rates at specific schools
- Limited to participating state schools
- Lower flexibility but eliminates tuition inflation risk
- Becoming less common

## Tax Treatment

### Federal Tax Benefits
- **No deduction** for contributions (contributions are after-tax)
- **Tax-free growth** — no annual taxation on earnings
- **Tax-free withdrawals** for qualified education expenses

### State Tax Benefits (Varies by State)
- **Full deduction states**: Can deduct contributions to any 529 plan
- **In-state deduction only**: Deduction only for in-state plan contributions
- **Tax credit states**: Some offer credits instead of deductions
- **No benefit states**: TX, CA, WA, and others with no state income tax

### Key State Examples

| State | Deduction (MFJ) | Plan Requirement |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| New York | $10,000 | In-state only |
| California | None | N/A |
| Illinois | $20,000 | In-state only |
| Pennsylvania | $34,000 | Any plan |
| Colorado | Unlimited | Any plan |

**Always check your state's rules** — they change and have various limits/requirements.

## Contribution Limits

### Gift Tax Considerations
- Annual gift exclusion: **$18,000/person** (2024), **$19,000** (2025)
- Married couples: **$36,000** (2024), **$38,000** (2025) per beneficiary
- No income limits on contributions (unlike Roth IRA)

### Superfunding (5-Year Gift Tax Averaging)
- Contribute up to **5 years' worth** of gifts at once
- 2025: Up to **$95,000** per person ($190,000/couple)
- Must file Form 709 to elect 5-year averaging
- No additional gifts to that beneficiary for 5 years

### Aggregate Limits
Each state sets a maximum total balance (varies $235,000 to $550,000+).
- This is per beneficiary, across all 529 plans for that beneficiary
- Growth beyond the limit is typically allowed; new contributions are blocked

## Qualified Education Expenses

### Higher Education (No Limit)
- Tuition and fees
- Books and supplies
- Computers and technology
- Room and board (limited to school's Cost of Attendance)
- Special needs services

### K-12 Education (Limited to $10,000/year)
- Tuition only at elementary/secondary schools
- **Federal**: $10,000/year cap
- **State**: Some states don't recognize K-12 as qualified; may recapture deductions

### Student Loan Repayment ($10,000 Lifetime)
- Added by SECURE Act 2019
- $10,000 lifetime per beneficiary
- Also $10,000 lifetime per sibling

### Apprenticeship Programs
- Registered apprenticeships qualify
- Added by SECURE Act 2019

## Non-Qualified Withdrawals

### Penalty
- **Earnings portion**: Subject to income tax + **10% federal penalty**
- **Principal portion**: No tax (it was after-tax money)

### Exceptions (No 10% Penalty)
- Beneficiary receives scholarship (can withdraw up to scholarship amount)
- Beneficiary attends military academy
- Beneficiary dies or becomes disabled
- Rolled over to Roth IRA (SECURE 2.0 rules)

## Changing Beneficiaries

### Family Members (Tax-Free Change)
Can change beneficiary to:
- Spouse, children, grandchildren, siblings
- Parents, aunts/uncles, nieces/nephews
- In-laws, step-relatives
- First cousins

### Gift Tax Implications
- Changing to **same generation**: No gift tax
- Changing to **younger generation**: May be treated as gift from original beneficiary

## 529-to-Roth IRA Rollover (SECURE 2.0)

### Overview
Starting January 1, 2024, unused 529 funds can be rolled over to a Roth IRA for the beneficiary.

### Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Account age | 529 must be open **15+ years** |
| Contribution age | Only amounts contributed **5+ years ago** |
| Annual limit | **$7,000** (2025), counts against Roth IRA limit |
| Lifetime limit | **$35,000** per beneficiary |
| Roth IRA owner | Must be the **529 beneficiary** |
| Income requirement | Beneficiary must have earned income ≥ rollover amount |
| Transfer method | Direct **trustee-to-trustee** only |
| Income limits | **None** (unlike regular Roth contributions) |

### What DOESN'T Apply
- Roth IRA income limits do NOT restrict 529 rollovers
- Can benefit high earners who can't otherwise contribute to Roth

### Example
**Sarah** has $35,000 left in her 529 (account opened 20 years ago). She earns $50,000/year.
- Year 1: Roll $7,000 to Roth IRA
- Year 2: Roll $7,000
- Year 3: Roll $7,000
- Year 4: Roll $7,000
- Year 5: Roll $7,000
- **Total**: $35,000 (hits lifetime limit)

If Sarah also wants to make regular Roth contributions, those compete with the annual limit.

### Beneficiary Change Clock Reset
**Critical**: Changing the beneficiary likely **restarts the 15-year clock**.
- New beneficiary must wait 15 years from when they became beneficiary
- Guidance on this is still being clarified by IRS

### State Tax Implications
- Some states may **recapture** previously claimed deductions
- Check your state's treatment of 529-to-Roth rollovers
- This is an evolving area — many states haven't clarified

## Financial Aid Impact

### FAFSA Treatment
- **Parent-owned 529**: Reported as parent asset (5.64% assessment rate max)
- **Grandparent-owned 529**: Previously problematic; **simplified rules starting 2024-2025 FAFSA** mean grandparent 529 distributions no longer reported as student income

### CSS Profile (Private Schools)
- May ask about grandparent assets
- More detailed asset reporting
- Impact varies by school

## Strategic Considerations

### Overfunding Strategies
With the Roth rollover option:
- Overfunding is less risky
- Unused funds have a tax-advantaged escape hatch
- Consider frontloading contributions to maximize tax-free growth

### Beneficiary Flexibility
- Use one 529 for multiple children sequentially
- First child doesn't use all → change beneficiary to sibling
- Unused after all children → consider grandchildren or Roth rollover

### State Arbitrage
If your state has no income tax or no 529 deduction:
- Shop for lowest-cost plan nationally (Utah, Nevada often recommended)
- Don't be limited to in-state plan

If your state has a deduction:
- Calculate breakeven: Is deduction worth any higher fees?
- Often yes for the contribution year; may move funds later

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting state tax recapture** — Non-qualified withdrawal may trigger state tax recapture of previous deductions
2. **Overfunding K-12** — Only $10,000/year is qualified; excess is non-qualified
3. **Missing scholarship exception** — Can withdraw scholarship amount penalty-free
4. **Wrong beneficiary on Roth rollover** — Must be the 529 beneficiary
5. **Ignoring 5-year contribution rule** — Recent contributions can't be rolled to Roth
6. **Not checking CSS Profile** — FAFSA simplification doesn't apply to private schools

## Decision Framework

### Open a 529 When:
- [ ] Have children or expect to have children
- [ ] Want tax-free growth for education expenses
- [ ] State offers meaningful deduction
- [ ] Comfortable with Roth rollover as backup for unused funds

### Superfund When:
- [ ] Have substantial savings to deploy
- [ ] Can commit to no additional gifts for 5 years
- [ ] Want to maximize early tax-free growth
- [ ] Estate planning goals (removes from estate immediately)

### Consider Alternatives When:
- [ ] Unsure if child will attend college
- [ ] State has no deduction and you want flexibility
- [ ] Already have substantial 529 balance
- [ ] Child likely to receive significant financial aid
