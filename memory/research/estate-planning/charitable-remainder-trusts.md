# Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs) — Complete Guide

*Maven Research | Last Updated: 2026-02-09*

---

## Executive Summary

Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs) are irrevocable split-interest trusts that provide income to non-charitable beneficiaries (typically the donor) while ultimately benefiting a charity. They're particularly powerful for clients with highly appreciated, low-basis assets who want to diversify while deferring capital gains, generate income, and support philanthropy.

**Key Benefits:**
- Immediate charitable income tax deduction
- Deferral of capital gains tax on appreciated assets
- Tax-exempt growth inside the trust
- Income stream to beneficiaries
- Estate planning benefits

**Best Fit:** Charitably-inclined clients with concentrated, low-basis positions who need income and have long time horizons.

## How CRTs Work

A CRT is a "split-interest" trust with two classes of beneficiaries:

1. **Income Beneficiaries** — Receive payments for a term of years (max 20) or for life
2. **Remainder Beneficiaries** — Charitable organizations receive what's left at trust termination

### The CRT Process

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Donor contributes appreciated assets to CRT                 │
│     → Receives immediate partial income tax deduction           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  2. CRT sells assets — NO capital gains tax at trust level      │
│     → Full proceeds reinvested (no tax drag)                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  3. CRT pays income to beneficiary (donor or others)            │
│     → Payments taxed using "worst-in-first-out" rules           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  4. At termination, remainder passes to charity                 │
│     → No estate tax on remainder value                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Two Main Types: CRAT vs CRUT

### Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust (CRAT)

**Fixed Dollar Amount:** Pays a set dollar amount each year, regardless of trust performance.

| Feature | CRAT |
|---------|------|
| Payment | Fixed dollar amount (sum certain) |
| Rate | 5% - 50% of initial fair market value |
| Additional contributions | **NOT allowed** |
| Exhaustion risk | Yes — if investments underperform |
| Best environment | **High interest rate** environment |
| Example | $1M contribution, 5% = $50,000/year forever |

**5% Exhaustion Test:** CRATs must have less than a 5% probability of exhausting before termination. At high payout rates in low-interest environments, this can be problematic.

**Alternative:** Rev. Proc. 2016-42 provides sample language that terminates the CRAT if assets drop to 10% of initial value, avoiding exhaustion risk.

### Charitable Remainder Unitrust (CRUT)

**Fixed Percentage:** Pays a percentage of trust assets, revalued annually.

| Feature | CRUT |
|---------|------|
| Payment | Fixed percentage of annual FMV |
| Rate | 5% - 50% of assets (revalued yearly) |
| Additional contributions | **Allowed** |
| Exhaustion risk | No — always pays percentage of what remains |
| Best environment | Any (less interest-rate sensitive) |
| Example | $1M contribution, 5% = $50,000 year 1, then varies |

**Key Advantage:** CRUTs self-adjust. Good years = higher payments. Bad years = lower payments. Never exhausts.

## CRUT Variations

### 1. Standard CRUT
- Pays fixed percentage of assets annually
- Simplest structure

### 2. Net Income CRUT (NICRUT)
- Pays lesser of: unitrust amount OR net income
- Useful for assets that don't generate current income (land, art, private business)
- No "make-up" for underpayments

### 3. Net Income with Makeup CRUT (NIMCRUT)
- Like NICRUT, but underpayments accrue in a "makeup account"
- When income exceeds unitrust amount, excess pays down makeup
- **Ideal for:** Pre-retirees who want to defer income until later years

### 4. Flip CRUT
- Starts as NICRUT or NIMCRUT
- "Flips" to standard CRUT upon a triggering event:
  - Reaching a certain age
  - Sale of an illiquid asset
  - Specific date
- After flip, makeup payments cease (for NIMCRUTs)
- **Ideal for:** Hard-to-sell assets that will eventually be liquidated

## Tax Treatment

### Charitable Deduction

The donor receives an income tax deduction equal to the **present value of the remainder interest** (what's expected to pass to charity).

**Calculation factors:**
- Value of contributed assets
- Payout rate
- Payout frequency
- Trust term or beneficiary life expectancy
- IRS Section 7520 rate (AFR-based assumed growth rate)

**The 10% Rule:** At least 10% of the initial FMV must be expected to pass to charity. High payout rates or long terms may violate this.

**CRAT in High Interest Rates:**
- Higher §7520 rate → smaller present value of retained interest
- → Larger remainder interest → **larger deduction**
- CRATs work better in high-rate environments

**CRUT Deduction:**
- Less sensitive to §7520 rate
- Uses Table U(1) based on payout rate and age

**AGI Limitations:**
- Cash: 60% AGI limit
- Appreciated property: 30% AGI limit
- Unused deduction: 5-year carryforward

### Four-Tier Income Taxation ("Worst-In-First-Out")

CRT distributions are taxed in this order:

| Tier | Character | Tax Rate |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Ordinary income (current year + carryover) | Up to 37% |
| 2 | Capital gains (including collectibles at 28%) | Up to 23.8% |
| 3 | Other income (tax-exempt interest) | 0% |
| 4 | Return of corpus (principal) | 0% |

**Key Implication:** The CRT defers but doesn't eliminate capital gains — they're distributed out over time in Tier 2.

### Trust-Level Taxation

- CRTs are **exempt from federal income tax** under §664(c)(1)
- **Exception:** Unrelated Business Taxable Income (UBTI) taxed at 100%
  - Avoid debt-financed property, certain partnerships
- Some states (e.g., New Jersey) tax CRTs at the state level

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: CRAT with Concentrated Stock

**Situation:** Jane, age 60, holds $1M of Apple stock with $100K cost basis. She's charitably inclined and needs income.

**Without CRT:**
- Sells stock: $1M - $100K = $900K gain
- Tax at 23.8% = $214,200
- Net proceeds: $785,800 to invest

**With CRAT (5% payout, using March 2025 §7520 rate of 5.4%):**
- Transfers $1M to CRAT
- Charitable deduction: ~$391,000 (present value of remainder)
- Tax savings at 35% bracket: $136,850
- CRT sells stock: $0 tax
- $1M fully invested
- Annual annuity: $50,000/year for life
- Tax on distributions: Tier 2 (capital gains) until exhausted

**Comparison:**

| Metric | Direct Sale | CRT |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Invested Capital | $785,800 | $1,000,000 |
| Upfront Tax Benefit | $0 | $136,850 deduction savings |
| Annual Income | $39,290 (at 5%) | $50,000 fixed |
| Control | Full | None (irrevocable) |
| Remainder | Estate | Charity |

### Example 2: NIMCRUT for Pre-Retiree

**Situation:** Tom, age 50, has a business worth $2M that he expects to sell in 10 years. He wants income in retirement.

**Structure:** NIMCRUT with 5% payout, flip to standard CRUT at age 65

**Years 1-15 (pre-flip):**
- Minimal net income = minimal distributions
- Makeup account accumulates

**Year 15 (flip on business sale):**
- Business sold within trust, no capital gains
- Trust now standard CRUT
- Large distributions begin

**Result:** Tom defers income to retirement years when he may be in lower bracket.

## Comparison: CRT vs DAF vs Private Foundation

| Feature | CRT | DAF | Private Foundation |
|---------|-----|-----|-------------------|
| Income to donor | Yes | No | No |
| Deduction for appreciated stock | 30% AGI | 30% AGI | Cost basis only |
| Timing flexibility | Fixed at creation | Grant anytime | 5%/year minimum |
| Asset sale | Tax-free | Tax-free | Tax-free |
| Control | Irrevocable | Advisory | Board control |
| Setup complexity | High | Low | High |
| Ongoing costs | Trustee fees | Low | Excise taxes, admin |
| Remainder | Charity | Charity | Charity |

## Estate Planning Considerations

### Estate Inclusion

- CRT value is included in donor's gross estate at death
- But estate gets charitable deduction for remainder interest
- If donor is only beneficiary: Full value deductible
- If successor beneficiary (non-spouse): Partial inclusion

### Non-Spouse Successor Beneficiary Problem

If a non-spouse successor receives CRT income:
- Present value of their interest is NOT deductible
- May generate estate tax
- CRT cannot pay estate taxes (§664 prohibition)

**Solution:** 
- Consider life insurance outside the estate (ILIT)
- Structure trust terms to minimize non-spouse interests
- Or: Require successor to pay their share of estate tax as condition

### Step-Up at Death

CRT interests do NOT receive step-up in basis — the deferred gains continue to be deferred gains for successor beneficiaries.

## QCD Election (SECURE 2.0)

Section 307 of SECURE 2.0 added a one-time QCD-to-CRT option:

- Individuals age 70½+ can distribute up to **$54,000 (2025, indexed)** from IRA directly to CRT
- One-time election per person
- CRT must be funded **exclusively** by QCDs
- Creates a small CRT ($50K range)

**Practical Issue:** Economics of administering such a small CRT may not make sense. Better suited for charitable gift annuities.

## When CRT Makes Sense vs. Doesn't

### Ideal Candidates

✅ Large concentrated position with very low basis
✅ Charitably inclined (wants to support causes)
✅ Needs current or future income stream
✅ Long time horizon (10+ years to termination)
✅ Comfortable giving up control and flexibility
✅ High income tax bracket (maximizes deduction value)
✅ Estate planning goals align with charitable remainder

### Less Suitable

❌ Young donors with long life expectancy (10% rule issues)
❌ Need for flexibility to change beneficiaries
❌ May need access to principal
❌ Small positions (legal/trustee costs outweigh benefits)
❌ Not charitably inclined
❌ Assets that generate UBTI
❌ States that tax CRTs

---

## Implementation Checklist

### Pre-Funding

1. **Determine CRT type** (CRAT vs CRUT variant)
2. **Select payout rate** (balance income need vs. 10% rule)
3. **Choose term** (lives vs. years, max 20)
4. **Identify trustee** (bank, trust company, or individual)
5. **Select remainder charity** (or multiple)
6. **Draft trust document** (must comply with §664 requirements)
7. **Obtain qualified appraisal** (if non-cash, non-publicly-traded assets)

### Funding

8. **Transfer assets** to trust
9. **Document transfer** with deed, assignment, etc.
10. **Obtain new EIN** for trust

### Post-Funding

11. **File Form 5227** (CRT annual return)
12. **Issue Schedule K-1** to beneficiaries
13. **Make required distributions** (at least annually)
14. **Maintain trust records**

## Key Takeaways

1. **CRTs unlock trapped gains** — Sell appreciated assets without immediate tax, diversify fully
2. **Income + deduction + charity** — Triple benefit for right situation
3. **Irrevocable = commitment** — Once funded, can't change your mind
4. **CRAT loves high rates** — Current environment (2025-2026) is favorable for CRATs
5. **NIMCRUT for deferred income** — Pre-retirees can shift income to lower-bracket years
6. **10% rule constrains design** — Can't go too aggressive on payout
7. **Avoid UBTI** — 100% tax rate kills the benefit
8. **Professional help required** — Complex trust document, ongoing administration
