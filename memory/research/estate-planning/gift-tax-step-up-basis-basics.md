## Executive Summary

Understanding the unified gift and estate tax system is fundamental to wealth transfer planning. The current **$15 million basic exclusion amount (2026)** provides significant opportunity for tax-free transfers, while the **step-up in basis** at death can eliminate decades of unrealized capital gains. This document covers the mechanics, thresholds, and decision frameworks.

## 1. The Unified Gift and Estate Tax System

### How It Works

The federal gift tax and estate tax operate as a **single unified system**:

1. **Lifetime Gifts**: Use up a portion of your unified credit
2. **At Death**: Remaining credit offsets estate tax
3. **Cumulative**: All taxable gifts are added to estate for tax calculation

### The Unified Credit

The credit is the tax equivalent of the Basic Exclusion Amount (BEA):

| Year | Basic Exclusion Amount | Married Couple (Portability) |
|------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| 2024 | $13,610,000 | $27,220,000 |
| 2025 | $13,990,000 | $27,980,000 |
| 2026 | $15,000,000 | $30,000,000 |

**Key Change for 2026**: The One, Big, Beautiful Bill (OBBB), signed July 4, 2025, set the BEA at $15,000,000 for 2026.

### Tax Rate

- **Maximum Estate/Gift Tax Rate**: 40%
- **Applies to**: Amounts exceeding the Basic Exclusion Amount

## 2. Annual Gift Tax Exclusion

### Current Limits

| Year | Annual Exclusion per Donee | Notes |
|------|---------------------------|-------|
| 2024 | $18,000 | Per recipient, per donor |
| 2025 | $19,000 | Per recipient, per donor |
| 2026 | $19,000 | (Projected) |

### Key Rules

1. **Per Donee**: Each recipient gets their own exclusion
2. **Per Donor**: Each spouse can give the annual exclusion
3. **Gift Splitting**: Married couples can elect to treat gifts as made 50/50
4. **No Reporting**: Gifts within annual exclusion don't require Form 709
5. **Present Interest**: Gift must be of present interest (not future)

### Example: Married Couple Gifting

```
Married couple with 3 children and 6 grandchildren (9 recipients)

Annual exclusion per donor: $19,000 (2025)
Combined annual gifting capacity: 
  2 donors × 9 recipients × $19,000 = $342,000/year

Over 10 years: $3,420,000 transferred without using lifetime exemption
```

### Gifts That Don't Count Against Exclusion

| Type | Requirement | Limit |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Tuition** | Paid directly to institution | Unlimited |
| **Medical** | Paid directly to provider | Unlimited |
| **Spousal** | To US citizen spouse | Unlimited |
| **Charitable** | To qualified charity | Unlimited |

---

## 3. Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption

### Using the Lifetime Exemption

Gifts exceeding the annual exclusion use lifetime exemption:

```
Example (2025):
Gift of $1,019,000 to child
Annual exclusion: $19,000
Taxable gift: $1,000,000

Lifetime exemption used: $1,000,000
Remaining exemption: $13,990,000 - $1,000,000 = $12,990,000
Actual tax owed: $0 (covered by unified credit)
```

### Form 709 Requirement

**Must file Form 709 (Gift Tax Return) when:**
- Gifts to any individual exceed annual exclusion
- Gift splitting with spouse
- Gifts of future interests
- Gifts to certain trusts

**Filing deadline**: April 15 (or extension) of year following gift

### The "Claw-Back" Protection

**IRS Anti-Abuse Rule (TD 9884):**
- If you make large gifts using current high exemption
- And exemption later decreases
- Your estate won't be penalized for prior gifts

The regulations use the **greater of** BEA at time of gift or at death.

## 4. Step-Up in Basis at Death

### The Fundamental Rule

**IRC Section 1014**: Property acquired from a decedent receives a basis equal to its **fair market value at date of death**.

### How It Works

```
Example:
Parent buys stock for $10,000 (original basis)
Stock grows to $1,000,000
Parent dies; child inherits

Child's basis: $1,000,000 (stepped-up to FMV at death)
Unrealized gain eliminated: $990,000
Capital gains tax saved: $990,000 × 23.8% = $235,620
```

### Step-Up vs. Carryover Basis

| Transfer Method | Recipient's Basis | Tax Impact |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **At Death** | FMV at death (step-up) | Gains eliminated |
| **Lifetime Gift** | Donor's basis (carryover) | Gains preserved |
| **Sale** | N/A - gain realized | Tax due immediately |

### Which Assets Get Step-Up?

**YES - Step-Up Applies:**
- Stocks and bonds
- Real estate
- Business interests
- Collectibles
- Most property owned at death

**NO - Step-Up Does NOT Apply:**
- IRAs/401(k)s (Income in Respect of Decedent - IRD)
- Annuities (deferred income)
- Property gifted within 1 year of death and returned to donor's estate
- Property transferred to revocable trust by someone other than decedent

### Consistent Basis Reporting (Section 1014(f))

**Since 2015**: Basis must be consistent with estate tax return value
- Executor reports values on Form 8971
- Beneficiaries must use reported value as basis
- Applies when estate tax return is required

---

## 5. Estate Tax Thresholds and Filing Requirements

### Who Must File Form 706?

**2025 Threshold**: Gross estate + adjusted taxable gifts > $13,990,000
**2026 Threshold**: Gross estate + adjusted taxable gifts > $15,000,000

### What's Included in Gross Estate?

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Probate Assets** | Bank accounts, brokerage, real estate in name |
| **Jointly Owned** | Portion includible varies by ownership type |
| **Beneficiary Assets** | Life insurance, IRAs, POD/TOD accounts |
| **Trusts** | Revocable trusts, trusts with retained interests |
| **Powers of Appointment** | General powers over trust assets |
| **Transfers with Retained Interest** | Life estates, GRATs (remainder) |

### Common Deductions

| Deduction | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Marital Deduction** | Unlimited; passes to surviving spouse tax-free |
| **Charitable Deduction** | Unlimited; passes to charity tax-free |
| **Debts and Expenses** | Mortgages, admin costs, funeral |
| **State Death Tax Deduction** | If state imposes estate tax |

## 6. Portability of Exemption

### What Is Portability?

Unused exemption of first spouse to die can transfer to surviving spouse.

### Requirements

1. **Timely File Form 706**: Even if not otherwise required
2. **Make DSUE Election**: Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion
3. **Filing Deadline**: 9 months (+ 6 month extension)
4. **Late Filing**: Rev. Proc. 2022-32 allows simplified late filing within 5 years

### Example

```
2025 Scenario:
Spouse A dies with $5,000,000 estate
Basic Exclusion Amount: $13,990,000
Unused Exclusion: $8,990,000

If Form 706 filed with DSUE election:
Spouse B's available exclusion: $13,990,000 + $8,990,000 = $22,980,000
```

### Portability Limitations

- Only from **last deceased spouse**
- Remarriage doesn't cause loss, but new spouse's death could
- Does NOT apply to GST exemption
- Does NOT apply if surviving spouse isn't US citizen

## 8. Decision Frameworks

### Gift vs. Bequest Decision

**GIFT during lifetime when:**
- [ ] Asset has LOW embedded gain (carryover basis impact minimal)
- [ ] Asset expected to appreciate significantly
- [ ] Want to use current high exemption before potential change
- [ ] Asset generates income you don't need
- [ ] State estate tax avoidance (removes asset from estate)

**BEQUEATH at death when:**
- [ ] Asset has HIGH embedded gain (step-up eliminates gains)
- [ ] Need asset for retirement income
- [ ] Want to maintain control
- [ ] Uncertain about beneficiary readiness
- [ ] Exemption expected to stay high

### Optimal Asset Selection for Gifts

| Best for Gifting | Best to Hold Until Death |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Low-basis cash | Highly appreciated stock |
| Life insurance premiums | Real estate with large gain |
| Assets expected to appreciate rapidly | Collectibles with high gain |
| Assets generating income you don't need | Business interests with built-in gain |
| Property in grantor trusts | Assets needed for retirement |

## 9. Key Planning Strategies

### Accelerated Gifting (2024-2026)

**Strategy**: Use current high exemption before potential future reduction

**IRS Guidance (Anti-Claw-Back)**: Treasury regulations confirm gifts made under higher exemption protected even if exemption decreases.

### Basis Step-Up Optimization

**Strategy**: Intentionally hold appreciated assets until death

```
Compare:
Sell $1M appreciated stock (basis $100K):
  Capital gains tax: $900K × 23.8% = $214,200

Hold until death:
  Capital gains tax: $0 (step-up)
  Estate tax: $0 (if under exemption)
  Savings: $214,200
```

### Gift/Bequest Combination

**Strategy**: Gift low-basis assets to ILIT; hold high-basis assets

1. Gift cash to Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust
2. ILIT purchases life insurance
3. Death benefit passes outside estate
4. Appreciated assets get step-up

## 10. Open Questions for Future Research

1. **Exemption Sunset Risk**: What planning makes sense if exemption could decrease?
2. **Step-Up Elimination**: Proposals to eliminate step-up - likelihood and planning?
3. **Valuation Discounts**: Current IRS stance on FLP/LLC valuation discounts?
4. **Trust Planning**: GRATs, SLATs, IDGTs - when do they make sense?
5. **State Tax Migration**: Planning around state estate tax through domicile change?
