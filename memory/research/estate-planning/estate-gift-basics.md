## Executive Summary: Post-OBBB Landscape

The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB)**, signed July 4, 2025, fundamentally changed the estate planning landscape:

| Item | 2025 | 2026+ (Post-OBBB) |
|------|------|-------------------|
| **Federal Exemption** | $13.99M/person | $15M/person (indexed) |
| **Married Couple** | $27.98M | $30M |
| **Top Rate** | 40% | 40% |
| **Sunset** | Was scheduled | **ELIMINATED** |
| **Annual Gift Exclusion** | $19,000 | $19,000 |

**Critical Change:** The TCJA sunset that would have dropped exemptions to ~$7M in 2026 **did not occur**. The OBBB made the higher exemptions permanent with continued inflation indexing starting 2027.

---

## 1. Gift Tax Fundamentals

### Annual Exclusion ($19,000 for 2025-2026)

- **Per-donee, per-year**: Can give $19,000 to unlimited recipients each year
- **No form required**: Annual exclusion gifts don't require Form 709
- **Married couples**: Each spouse has own $19,000 exclusion = $38,000/person/year without gift splitting
- **Non-citizen spouse exception**: $194,000 annual exclusion for gifts to non-citizen spouse (2026)

### Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption

| Year | Individual | Married Couple |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 2024 | $13.61M | $27.22M |
| 2025 | $13.99M | $27.98M |
| 2026 | $15.00M | $30.00M |
| 2027+ | Indexed for inflation | Indexed |

**IRS Anti-Clawback Rule (Nov 2019):** The IRS confirmed in final regulations that gifts made using the higher exemption amounts will NOT be "clawed back" if exemptions are later reduced. This was relevant to TCJA sunset concerns and provides comfort for future legislative changes.

### Gift Splitting for Married Couples (IRC §2513)

**What It Is:** Married couples can elect to treat gifts made by one spouse as made 50% by each spouse.

**Requirements:**
- Both spouses must consent (sign Form 709)
- Both must be U.S. citizens or residents
- Must apply to ALL gifts made during the year
- Each spouse must file Form 709

**Example:** Husband gives $100,000 to child. With gift splitting:
- Husband: $50,000 gift (uses $31,000 of lifetime exemption after $19K annual exclusion)
- Wife: $50,000 gift (uses $31,000 of lifetime exemption after $19K annual exclusion)

**Deadline:** Election must be made by April 15 (or extended deadline) of following year.

### What Counts as a Gift?

**Direct Transfers:**
- Cash, securities, real estate
- Forgiveness of debt
- Adding someone to title (partial gift)

**Below-Market Loans (IRC §7872):**
- Loans charging less than AFR (Applicable Federal Rate) are treated as gifts
- The forgone interest (difference between AFR and actual interest) = gift
- **De minimis exception:** Loans of $10,000 or less are generally exempt if not used to buy income-producing assets
- **$100,000 exception:** For loans between $10K-$100K, imputed interest limited to borrower's net investment income

**Special Situations:**
- **Crummey notices:** Powers of withdrawal make trust contributions present-interest gifts
- **529 contributions:** Can front-load 5 years of annual exclusions ($95,000 in 2025)
- **UTMA/UGMA:** Immediate gifts to minors
- **Payment of another's expenses:** Generally taxable (except below)

**NOT Gifts (Exclusions):**
- Direct payment of tuition to educational institution (unlimited)
- Direct payment of medical expenses to provider (unlimited)
- Gifts to spouse (unlimited marital deduction, if U.S. citizen)
- Political contributions
- Charitable gifts (deductible, not excluded)

## 2. Estate Tax Fundamentals

### Basic Exclusion Amount (2026)

| Status | Exclusion | Rate |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Individual | $15,000,000 | 40% max |
| Married (with portability) | $30,000,000 | 40% max |

### Tax Rate Structure

The federal estate tax is progressive with rates from 18% to 40%:

| Taxable Estate | Rate |
|----------------|------|
| $0 - $10,000 | 18% |
| $10,001 - $20,000 | 20% |
| $20,001 - $40,000 | 22% |
| $40,001 - $60,000 | 24% |
| $60,001 - $80,000 | 26% |
| $80,001 - $100,000 | 28% |
| $100,001 - $150,000 | 30% |
| $150,001 - $250,000 | 32% |
| $250,001 - $500,000 | 34% |
| $500,001 - $750,000 | 37% |
| $750,001 - $1,000,000 | 39% |
| Over $1,000,000 | 40% |

**Effective Rate:** Due to unified credit, only amounts above exemption are taxed at graduated rates.

### The 2026 Sunset That Didn't Happen

**Original TCJA Provision (2017):**
- Doubled exemption from ~$5.5M to ~$11M
- Set to expire December 31, 2025
- Would have dropped to ~$7M (inflation-adjusted $5M base)

**OBBB Resolution (July 2025):**
- Raised exemption to $15M starting January 1, 2026
- **No sunset provision** - permanent
- Inflation indexing continues from 2027

### Portability (DSUE - Deceased Spousal Unused Exclusion)

**What It Is:** Surviving spouse can use deceased spouse's unused exemption.

**Requirements:**
1. **File Form 706** within 9 months of death (or 15 months with extension)
2. **Election is automatic** unless opted out (complete Part 6, Section B)
3. Doesn't require estate to owe tax - just requires filing

**Key Rules:**
- DSUE amount = Deceased spouse's unused applicable exclusion
- Surviving spouse can use for both lifetime gifts AND estate
- Only **last deceased spouse** counts (remarriage resets DSUE)
- **5-year rule:** Rev. Proc. 2022-32 allows portability election up to 5 years after death for estates below filing threshold

**Example:**
- Husband dies in 2026 with $3M taxable estate, exemption is $15M
- DSUE = $15M - $3M = $12M
- Wife files Form 706 electing portability
- Wife now has: $15M (own) + $12M (DSUE) = $27M exemption

**Strategic Note:** Even with OBBB's permanent high exemptions, portability filing is still valuable as:
- Congress can change laws
- Provides flexibility
- State estate taxes don't have portability

### Form 706 Filing Requirements

**Must File If:**
- Gross estate + adjusted taxable gifts + specific exemption > filing threshold ($15M in 2026)
- OR electing portability (regardless of estate size)

**Due Date:** 9 months after death (automatic 6-month extension via Form 4768)

**Attachments Required:**
- Death certificate
- Will and trust documents
- Appraisals for real estate, business interests, unique assets
- Prior gift tax returns (Forms 709)

---

## 3. Step-Up in Basis (IRC §1014)

### How It Works

**General Rule:** Property acquired from a decedent receives a basis equal to fair market value at date of death (or alternate valuation date).

**Example:**
- Parent bought stock for $50,000
- Stock worth $500,000 at death
- Child inherits with $500,000 basis
- **$450,000 gain is permanently eliminated**

### What Gets Step-Up

**Included:**
- Property in decedent's gross estate
- Property passing by will or intestacy
- Jointly-held property (proportionate to ownership)
- Trust assets included in estate
- POD/TOD accounts
- Life insurance (basis doesn't matter, but proceeds included)

**Excluded:**
- IRD (Income in Respect of Decedent) - IRAs, 401(k)s, deferred annuities
- Property gifted before death (carryover basis)
- Irrevocable trust assets not in estate
- Assets sold before death

### Community Property Double Step-Up (IRC §1014(b)(6))

**The Big Advantage:** In community property states, BOTH halves of community property receive step-up at first spouse's death.

**Example (Community Property - California):**
- Couple bought stock for $100,000 as community property
- Worth $1,000,000 at first spouse's death
- Surviving spouse's basis: **$1,000,000** (100% step-up)
- All $900,000 gain eliminated

**Example (Separate Property - New York):**
- Same facts, joint account in separate property state
- Surviving spouse's basis: $550,000 (only 50% step-up)
- $450,000 gain remains on surviving spouse's half

**Community Property States (9):**
1. Arizona
2. California
3. Idaho
4. Louisiana
5. Nevada
6. New Mexico
7. Texas
8. Washington
9. Wisconsin

**Opt-In Community Property Trust States (3):**
1. Alaska (since 1998)
2. Tennessee (since 2010)
3. Kentucky (since 2020)
4. South Dakota (community property trusts)

**Key Point:** Non-community property state residents can potentially create community property trusts in opt-in states to gain double step-up benefits.

### Basis Consistency Rules (IRC §1014(f) / Form 8971)

**Enacted 2015:** Beneficiary's basis cannot exceed value reported on estate tax return.

**Form 8971 Requirements:**
- Filed by executor within 30 days of Form 706 filing
- Schedule A sent to each beneficiary
- Reports value of inherited property

**When Required:**
- Estate is required to file Form 706 (above filing threshold)
- Property generates estate tax liability

**When NOT Required:**
- Estate doesn't need to file Form 706
- Property qualifies for marital or charitable deduction (no tax generated)
- Property excluded from reporting (cash, IRD, etc.)

### Planning Implications

**Gift vs. Bequest Analysis:**

| Factor | Lifetime Gift | Bequest at Death |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| Basis | Carryover (donor's basis) | Step-up to FMV |
| Capital gains | Beneficiary inherits | Eliminated |
| Best for | Low-basis assets you'll hold | High-appreciation assets |
| Exemption use | Uses lifetime exemption | Uses estate exemption |

**Rule of Thumb:** For assets with significant unrealized gains, inheritance (step-up) often beats gifts (carryover basis) from an income tax perspective.

**Spousal Planning in Separate Property States:**
- Consider retitling appreciated assets to terminally ill spouse
- **1-year rule (IRC §1014(e)):** Assets gifted to decedent within 1 year of death that return to donor do NOT get step-up
- Solution: Leave to other beneficiaries, not back to donor spouse

## 4. State Estate and Inheritance Taxes

### States with Estate Tax (12 + DC as of 2026)

| State | Exemption | Top Rate | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Connecticut** | $15,000,000 (federal tie) | 12% (flat) | Only state matching federal; has gift tax |

| **Washington** | $3,076,000 | 35% | **Highest rate** (increased 2025) |
| **Washington DC** | $4,988,400 | 16% | Indexed |

### States with Inheritance Tax (5)

| State | Rates | Who Pays | Exemptions |
|-------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Kentucky** | 4-16% | Non-lineal heirs | Spouse, parents, children, siblings exempt |
| **Maryland** | 10% (flat) | Collateral heirs | Close relatives exempt |
| **Nebraska** | 1%, 11%, 15% | Based on relationship | $100K (immediate), $40K (remote), $25K (others) |
| **New Jersey** | 11-16% | Non-immediate family | Spouse, descendants, ancestors exempt |
| **Pennsylvania** | 4.5%, 12%, 15% | All except spouses | **No exemption** except spouse; 4.5% for lineal |

**Key Distinction:**
- **Estate Tax:** Paid by the estate before distribution
- **Inheritance Tax:** Paid by beneficiary after receipt

**Maryland:** Only state with BOTH estate tax AND inheritance tax

### 2025 Notable Changes

1. **Iowa:** Inheritance tax fully repealed January 1, 2025
2. **Washington:** Increased rates (top rate now 35%, up from 20%); exemption also increased to $3M

### State Planning Strategies

**Residence Planning:**
- Consider domicile in states without estate tax (FL, TX, NV, etc.)
- Must establish genuine connections (driver's license, voting, time spent)
- IRS and states examine "domicile of choice"

**Real Property Considerations:**
- Real property taxed by situs state regardless of domicile
- Vacation homes in estate tax states create exposure
- Consider LLCs or trusts (but watch state look-through rules)

**State QTIP Elections:**
- Most estate tax states allow separate state QTIP election
- Allows marital deduction at state level while funding bypass trust

## 5. Community Property Regimes

### The 9 Community Property States

| State | Income from Separate Property | Notes |
|-------|------------------------------|-------|
| **Arizona** | Separate | Quasi-community property rules |
| **California** | Separate | Strictest rules |
| **Idaho** | Community | |
| **Louisiana** | Community | Based on civil law tradition |
| **Nevada** | Separate | |
| **New Mexico** | Separate | |
| **Texas** | Community | |
| **Washington** | Separate | |
| **Wisconsin** | Community | "Marital property" terminology |

### Community vs. Separate Property

**Community Property:**
- Acquired during marriage through earnings of either spouse
- Belongs 50/50 to each spouse regardless of title
- Gets double step-up at first death

**Separate Property:**
- Owned before marriage
- Received by gift or inheritance during marriage
- Purchased with separate funds (must trace)
- Keeps original basis

### Common Law (Separate Property) States

**All other 41 states** follow common law/separate property rules:
- Property belongs to spouse who earns/acquires it
- Joint accounts = 50/50 ownership
- Only decedent's share gets step-up

### Opt-In Community Property Trust States

**Alaska (1998):**
- Allows community property trusts
- Both spouses must consent
- Property transferred to trust becomes community property

**Tennessee (2010):**
- Similar to Alaska
- "Community property trust" statutory framework

**Kentucky (2020):**
- Newest opt-in state
- Requires proper trust documentation

**South Dakota:**
- Allows community property trusts under special provisions

**Planning Use:** Residents of separate property states can establish trusts in opt-in states to achieve double step-up benefits.

### Moving Between Regimes

**Community → Separate Property State:**
- Property retains community character
- Gets double step-up benefit
- Must maintain documentation

**Separate → Community Property State:**
- Existing separate property stays separate
- Future earnings become community
- Can transmute by agreement

**Documentation Critical:**
- Keep records of property character
- Written agreements for transmutation
- Title alone doesn't determine character

## 6. Planning Strategies in the OBBB Era

### The New Landscape (Post-OBBB)

**What Changed:**
- $15M exemption permanent (no sunset)
- Urgency of "use it or lose it" reduced
- Focus shifts to income tax planning (step-up)
- State estate taxes become relatively more important

**What Didn't Change:**
- 40% top rate
- Annual exclusion mechanics
- Portability rules
- Step-up in basis rules
- State estate taxes

### Still-Relevant Planning Strategies

#### A. Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT)

**What It Is:** Irrevocable trust created by one spouse for benefit of other spouse (and descendants).

**Benefits:**
- Removes assets from donor spouse's estate
- Future appreciation excluded from both estates
- Beneficiary spouse can receive distributions if needed
- Grantor trust = no income tax on growth

**2026 Funding Limits:**
- Individual: Up to $15M
- Couple (each creates SLAT): Up to $30M total

**Key Risks:**
1. **Divorce:** Beneficiary spouse may retain trust benefits
2. **Predeceased beneficiary spouse:** Lose indirect access
3. **Reciprocal trust doctrine:** If both spouses create "mirror" SLATs, IRS may collapse them

**Reciprocal Trust Mitigation:**
- Create at different times
- Different trustees
- Different distribution standards
- Different beneficiary classes
- Different investment provisions

#### B. Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)

**How It Works:**
- Transfer appreciating assets to trust
- Retain annuity payments for term
- Remainder passes to beneficiaries gift-tax-free if appreciation exceeds IRS rate (Section 7520 rate)

**Best For:** Assets expected to significantly appreciate

#### C. Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)

**How It Works:**
- Sell assets to grantor trust in exchange for promissory note
- Trust grows outside estate
- Grantor pays income tax on trust income (further reducing estate)
- Note payments return to grantor

**Best For:** Business interests, high-growth assets

#### D. Charitable Planning

**Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT):**
- Income stream to donor for life
- Remainder to charity
- Immediate income tax deduction
- Removes assets from estate

**Charitable Lead Trust (CLT):**
- Income to charity for term
- Remainder to family
- Estate/gift tax reduction

#### E. Life Insurance Planning

**Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT):**
- Trustee owns policy
- Proceeds excluded from estate
- Provides liquidity for estate taxes/expenses

### Gift vs. Bequest Decision Framework

**Favor Lifetime Gifts When:**
- Assets have low basis AND low expected appreciation
- Using annual exclusion gifts
- Leveraging gift tax exemption before potential law changes
- Funding education (529 plans)
- State has no gift tax but has estate tax

**Favor Bequest (Hold Until Death) When:**
- Assets have significant unrealized gains
- Step-up will eliminate substantial capital gains
- Uncertain about future need for assets
- Asset may decline in value
- Beneficiary likely to sell immediately

### Portability vs. Bypass Trust

**Portability Advantages:**
- Simpler (just file Form 706)
- Surviving spouse has full control
- Step-up on second death
- No trust administration costs

**Bypass Trust Advantages:**
- Protects from creditors
- Protects from remarriage
- Can benefit multiple generations
- May reduce state estate tax
- Locks in exemption amount (no future legislative risk)

**Modern Approach:** "Wait and see" or "disclaimer" trusts that allow post-death flexibility.
