## Executive Summary

The estate and gift tax system in the United States offers significant planning opportunities for wealth transfer. With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 making the $15 million lifetime exemption permanent and inflation-adjusted, clients have unprecedented certainty for large transfers.

**Key thresholds for 2026:**
- **Annual gift exclusion:** $19,000 per recipient ($38,000 married couple)
- **Lifetime gift/estate exemption:** $15 million per individual ($30 million married)
- **Estate tax rate:** Up to 40% on amounts above exemption
- **Gift tax rate:** Progressive, same as estate tax

---

## 1. Federal Estate Tax Fundamentals

### The Basic Exemption

| Year | Lifetime Exemption (Individual) | Lifetime Exemption (Married) |
|------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 2024 | $13.61 million | $27.22 million |
| 2025 | $14.13 million | $28.26 million |
| 2026 | $15.00 million | $30.00 million |

**Note:** OBBBA (July 2025) made the exemption permanent and inflation-adjusted going forward.

### Estate Tax Rates

| Taxable Estate | Rate |
|----------------|------|
| $0 - $10,000 | 18% |
| $10,001 - $20,000 | 20% |
| $20,001 - $40,000 | 22% |
| $40,001 - $60,000 | 24% |
| $60,001 - $80,000 | 26% |
| $80,001 - $100,000 | 28% |
| $100,001 - $150,000 | 30% |
| $150,001 - $250,000 | 32% |
| $250,001 - $500,000 | 34% |
| $500,001 - $750,000 | 37% |
| $750,001 - $1,000,000 | 39% |
| $1,000,001+ | 40% |

**Effective rates are much lower** due to the large exemption. For estates at $15 million, the effective rate is around 12-15%.

### Filing Requirements

| Situation | Filing Requirement |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Gross estate ≤ exemption | No federal return required |
| Gross estate > exemption | Form 706 due 9 months after death |
| Annual gifts > annual exclusion | Form 709 due April 15 |

### Portability Election

**Key feature:** Surviving spouse can inherit deceased spouse's unused exemption ("DSUE").

**Process:** File Form 706 (even if no tax due) to elect portability within 9 months of death.

**Example:**
- Husband dies 2025 with $7 million estate (half of $14.13M exemption)
- Wife inherits his $7.065M DSUE
- Wife's total exemption: $7.065M (her own) + $7.065M (inherited) = $14.13M

**Planning implication:** portability eliminates need for "credit shelter trusts" in many cases.

## 2. Gift Tax: The Annual Exclusion

### Annual Exclusion Amounts

| Year | Per Recipient (Individual) | Per Recipient (Married Couple) |
|------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2025 | $19,000 | $38,000 |
| 2026 | $19,000 | $38,000 |

**Key points:**
- Unlimited number of recipients
- No reporting requirement for gifts within exclusion
- Reduces lifetime exemption only for amounts exceeding exclusion

### Gift Splitting

Married couples can combine their annual exclusions:

- File Form 709 to show "split gifts"
- Each spouse's exclusion applied separately
- Must consent in writing (spousal consent rules)

### Who Can Receive Gifts

| Recipient | Rules |
|-----------|-------|
| Anyone | No limit on number of recipients |
| Minor children | Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or 529 plan recommended |
| Non-citizen spouse | $194,000 annual limit (2026, up from $190,000 in 2025) |
| Foreign individuals | No gift tax, but may have reporting (Form 3520) |
| Trusts | Possible, but more complex (Crummey withdrawals, etc.) |

### Examples

**Example 1: Grandchildren**
- 4 grandchildren × $19,000 = $76,000 total gift per grandparent
- Married couple = $152,000 total
- All from annual exclusion, no lifetime exemption used

**Example 2: Education gifts**
- Pay tuition directly to institution = unlimited (not a completed gift)
- Books, supplies = unlimited (if required for enrollment)
- Room and board = counted as gift (use annual exclusion)

**Example 3: Medical gifts**
- Pay medical bills directly to provider = unlimited
- Reimburse patient = counted as gift

---

## 3. Lifetime Exemption Strategy

### How It Works

Every gift above the annual exclusion reduces the $15 million (2026) lifetime exemption:

| Gift Amount | Annual Exclusion Used | Lifetime Exemption Used |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| $19,000 | $19,000 | $0 |
| $100,000 | $19,000 | $81,000 |
| $1,000,000 | $19,000 | $981,000 |

### Gift Tax Calculation

**Formula:** Gift Tax = (Taxable Gift × Rate) - Credit Against Tax

The credit equals the tax on the exemption amount, effectively zeroing out tax on gifts up to the exemption.

### The "Clawback" Concern (Resolved)

**Pre-2026 concern:** If exemption decreased, prior large gifts might be "taxed back."

**OBBBA resolution:** The new law includes a **no-clawback rule**. Gifts made during higher exemption periods are safe even if exemption decreases in the future.

**Planning implication:** Large gifts made before 2026 (or whenever exemption peaks) are now permanently protected.

### Optimal Gift Amounts

| Client Situation | Recommended Gift Strategy |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Wealth > $15M exemption | Use remaining exemption aggressively |
| Wealth > $30M married | Both spouses maximize gifts |
| Expecting appreciation | Gift appreciating assets now (freeze strategy) |
| Business owner | Consider S corporation or partnership interest gifts |

## 4. Step-Up in Basis: Critical Context

### What Is Step-Up?

When someone dies, their appreciated assets receive a "step-up" in cost basis to fair market value at death.

| Asset | Basis Before Death | Basis After Death |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Stock bought at $10, now $100 | $10 | $100 |
| Real estate bought at $100K, now $1M | $100K | $1M |

**Benefit:** Eliminates capital gains tax on appreciation during lifetime.

### Step-Up vs. Lifetime Gifting

| Factor | Step-Up (Death) | Lifetime Gift |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Basis | Steps up to FMV | Carryover basis |
| Capital gains tax | Eliminated | Taxed at transfer |
| Gift tax | N/A | May apply |
| Control | Lost | Retained during lifetime |

**Example:**
- Grandmother owns stock worth $1M (basis $100K)
- Options:
  1. Hold until death: Heirs get $1M basis, no tax
  2. Gift now: Heirs get $100K basis, owe ~$180K capital gains (at 20% rate)

### When Gifting Beats Step-Up

Despite losing step-up, gifts can be better when:

1. **Asset will appreciate more:** Lock in current value for gift tax purposes
2. **Income needs:** Donor needs cash flow, donee can wait
3. **Multi-generational planning:** Shifting future appreciation to lower-bracket recipients
4. **Business interests:** Reduce estate while maintaining some control

### Step-Up Elimination Proposals

**Historical proposals:** Eliminate step-up in basis at death
**Current status:** Not in OBBBA, but remains a potential future reform

**Planning implication:** Clients with large unrealized gains should consider the possibility of future elimination, but not panic given current law.

## 5. State Estate Taxes

| State | Exemption (2025-2026) | Top Rate |
|-------|----------------------|----------|
| Connecticut | ~$15.99M (2026, matches federal) | 12% |
| District of Columbia | ~$4.71M | 16% |
| Hawaii | ~$5.49M | 20% |

### Planning for State Taxes

| Client Situation | Strategy |
|-----------------|----------|
| Domiciled in estate tax state | Consider domicile change (no state income tax states: FL, TX, NV, etc.) |
| Owns property in estate tax state | Residency matters more than property location |
| Married couples | Portability varies by state (not all states have it) |
| Multi-state assets | Most states tax based on decedent's domicile, not asset location |

## 6. Common Gifting Strategies

### Strategy 1: Annual Exclusion Gifting

**Mechanics:** Give $19K/year to as many recipients as desired.

**Best for:** Gradual wealth transfer, teaching financial literacy.

**Example:**
- Married couple with 3 grandchildren
- 6 gifts × $19K = $114K/year
- Over 10 years = $1.14M transferred, $0 exemption used

### Strategy 2: 529 Plan Education Gifting

**Limits:** Up to $19K/year (or $38K married) without gift tax consequences.
**Special rule:** Can front-load 5 years of gifts = $95K single/$190K married.

**Benefits:**
- Section 529 plan grows tax-free
- Withdrawals for qualified education expenses = tax-free
- Control over investments (if custodial account rules followed)
- Beneficiary can be changed

**Qualified expenses:**
- Tuition
- Fees
- Books
- Room and board (if half-time student)
- Computers/internet
- Special needs equipment

### Strategy 3: Direct Payment of Medical/Educational Expenses

**Mechanics:** Pay directly to institution/provider (not to the individual).

**Benefits:**
- Unlimited amount (no annual exclusion limit)
- No gift tax consequences
- No reduction of lifetime exemption

**Documentation:** Keep records showing payment was for tuition/medical, not cash to individual.

### Strategy 4: Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)

**Mechanics:**
1. Create irrevocable trust
2. Trust purchases/life insurance owned by trust
3. Trust pays premiums (via gifts from insured)
4. Upon death, death benefit paid to trust → beneficiaries

**Benefits:**
- Removes life insurance from taxable estate
- Provides liquidity for estate taxes
- Creates tax-free wealth transfer

**Downsides:**
- Irrevocable (cannot change)
- Loss of control
- Must survive 3 years after transfer (Section 2035)

### Strategy 5: Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)

**Mechanics:**
- Transfer appreciating asset to trust
- Receive fixed annuity for term (typically 2-10 years)
- Remainder goes to beneficiaries (gift tax free if zeroed out)
- If you die during term, asset returns to estate

**Benefits:**
- Zeroed-out GRAT uses no exemption
- Appreciation above IRS 7520 rate goes to beneficiaries tax-free
- Can "roll" GRATs (create new ones as old ones expire)

**Ideal for:** Highly appreciated assets, business interests, real estate

### Strategy 6: Family Limited Partnership (FLP/LLC)

**Mechanics:**
- Create partnership/LLC
- Transfer assets to entity
- Gift partnership interests to family
- Retain management control

**Benefits:**
- Valuation discounts (minority interest, lack of marketability)
- Maintain control during lifetime
- Gift at discounted values

**Downsides:**
- IRS scrutiny (adequate business purpose required)
- Complex setup and maintenance
- Potential GST tax issues

## 7. Community Property vs. Common Law States

### The Difference

| Feature | Community Property | Common Law |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Ownership during marriage | Equal (50/50) | Based on title |
| Income during marriage | Community property | Separate (unless commingled) |
| Inheritance | May have special rules | Standard rules |

**Community property states:** AZ, CA, ID, LA, NV, NM, TX, WA, WI (and AK for opt-in)

### Double Step-Up Basis

**In community property states:** Surviving spouse gets **double step-up** on community property.

**What this means:**
- Both halves of community property get step-up at death
- Effectively eliminates capital gains on all community property appreciation

**Common law equivalent:** Only deceased spouse's half gets step-up

**Example:**
- Married couple in CA, community property, $10M stock portfolio (basis $1M)
- Both spouses die: $10M receives **double step-up** (both halves)
- Heirs get $10M basis (no capital gains tax)
- Same couple in NY: Only decedent's half ($5M) steps up
- Surviving spouse's half retains $500K basis (taxable when sold)

**Planning implication:** Community property status is extremely valuable for estate planning.

### Making Common Law Property Community

Some states (like AK) allow elective community property.

**Benefit:** Convert property to community property for double step-up benefit.

## 8. Key Planning Considerations

### Before Making Large Gifts

| Consideration | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| Cash flow needs | Ensure gift won't strain finances |
| Emergency reserves | Maintain 6-12 months expenses |
| Retirement security | Fund retirement fully first |
| Long-term care | Consider LTC insurance or self-insurance |

### Documentation Requirements

|----------|---------|
| Gift tax return (Form 709) | Track lifetime exemption usage |
| Appraisal | For non-cash gifts >$15K |
| Business valuation | For business interest gifts |
| Trust documents | For ILIT, GRAT, other trusts |

### Family Dynamics

| Issue | Consideration |
|-------|--------------|
| Unequal gifting | Can cause family conflict |
| Spendthrift children | Use trusts with distributions |
| Blended families | Spousal lifetime access trusts (SLATs) |
| Minors | UGMA/UTMA or 529 plans |

### GST (Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Rate | 40% (same as estate tax) |
| Exemption | Same as lifetime exemption ($15M in 2026) |
| Applicability | Transfers to grandchildren or more remote descendants |
| Planning | Allocate GST exemption to skip-generation gifts |
