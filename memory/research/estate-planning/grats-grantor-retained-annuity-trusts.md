# Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)

*Tax-efficient wealth transfer using the IRS's own interest rate assumptions against them*

---

## Executive Summary

A GRAT is an **irrevocable trust** that allows high-net-worth individuals to transfer appreciation on assets to heirs while using **little or no lifetime gift tax exemption**. The key insight: if trust assets grow faster than the IRS's assumed rate (Section 7520 rate), the excess passes to beneficiaries **gift and estate tax-free**.

**Why this matters in 2026:**
- Current estate exemption: ~$13.99M/person ($27.98M married)
- **TCJA scheduled sunset** previously at end of 2025, but OBBBA extended to ~$15M/person starting 2026
- Still valuable for transferring appreciation tax-free
- Key tool for ultra-high-net-worth planning

---

## How GRATs Work

### Basic Mechanics

1. **Grantor transfers assets** into an irrevocable trust
2. **Grantor receives annuity payments** for a fixed term (typically 2-10 years)
3. **Annuity calculated** using IRS Section 7520 rate (hurdle rate)
4. **At term end**, remaining assets pass to beneficiaries
5. **If assets outperform hurdle rate**, excess passes **tax-free**

### The "Zeroed-Out" GRAT

Most practitioners structure GRATs so the **present value of annuity payments equals the transferred assets**, resulting in:
- Gift value of remainder interest ≈ $0 (or $1 nominal)
- Uses virtually no lifetime gift exemption
- Any growth above hurdle rate passes tax-free

---

## The Section 7520 Hurdle Rate

### What It Is

The **7520 rate** is an IRS-prescribed interest rate updated monthly, based on 120% of the mid-term Applicable Federal Rate (AFR). It represents what the IRS assumes the trust assets will earn.

### Current Rates (2025-2026)

| Month | 7520 Rate |
|-------|-----------|
| June 2025 | ~5.0% |
| (Rates fluctuate monthly) | |

### Why Lower Rates = Better GRATs

- Lower hurdle rate = easier to beat with actual returns
- More likely to transfer substantial wealth tax-free
- Historically low rates (2020-2021 ~0.4-2%) were exceptional opportunities

---

## GRAT Term Length Considerations

### Short-Term GRATs (2-3 years)

**Advantages:**
- Lower mortality risk (grantor must survive the term)
- Can "roll" into subsequent GRATs (rolling GRAT strategy)
- More opportunities to reset hurdle rate if rates decline
- Less commitment if strategy isn't working

**Disadvantages:**
- Less time for assets to compound above hurdle
- Administrative costs per GRAT

### Long-Term GRATs (5-10 years)

**Advantages:**
- Lock in current hurdle rate for longer period
- More time for significant appreciation
- Fewer GRATs to administer

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher mortality risk
- Less flexibility to adjust strategy
- Potentially stuck with unfavorable hurdle rate if rates decline

### Rolling GRATs Strategy

Instead of one long GRAT, create a **series of short-term GRATs**:
- Fund new GRAT each year (or as annuity payments come in)
- Principal stays in trust form longer
- Provides flexibility to adjust to rate environment
- Most common approach for sophisticated planning

---

## Annuity Payment Structure

### Fixed vs. Graduated Payments

**Fixed payments:** Same amount each year

**Graduated payments:** Can increase by up to **20% annually**
- Leaves more assets in trust early on
- Greater compounding opportunity
- Higher ending transfers to beneficiaries

### Example: Graduated Payment Structure

$1M GRAT, 5-year term, 20% annual increases:

| Year | Annuity Payment |
|------|-----------------|
| 1 | $180,000 |
| 2 | $216,000 |
| 3 | $259,200 |
| 4 | $311,040 |
| 5 | $373,248 |

**Total returned:** $1,339,488 (exceeds principal due to hurdle rate)

## Ideal GRAT Assets

### Best Candidates

1. **Pre-IPO stock** — High appreciation potential with known catalyst
2. **Closely-held business interests** — Often with valuation discounts
3. **Hedge fund investments** — Potential for outsized returns
4. **Real estate** — Appreciating property (may require appraisals)
5. **Growth stocks** — Assets expected to significantly outperform hurdle rate
6. **Leveraged positions** — Magnify potential outperformance

### Why These Work

- GRAT "wins" when assets grow > hurdle rate
- High-growth assets maximize transfer potential
- Volatile assets can benefit from rolling GRAT strategy (catch upswings)

### Asset Flexibility Feature

GRATs allow **asset substitution** during the term:
- Swap high-basis assets for low-basis assets
- Remove appreciated assets and replace with cash (lock in gains)
- Access liquidity if needed (swap liquid for illiquid)
- Manage around market conditions

---

## Tax Treatment

### Gift Tax

**Zeroed-out GRAT:**
- Gift value ≈ $0 (technically remainder interest value)
- Uses minimal lifetime exemption
- Gift tax return (Form 709) required to report

### Estate Tax

**If grantor survives term:**
- Trust assets pass to beneficiaries outside grantor's estate
- All appreciation above hurdle rate = estate tax free

**If grantor dies during term:**
- Remaining trust assets **included in grantor's estate**
- Defeats purpose of GRAT for estate planning

### Income Tax

**Grantor trust status:**
- All income, gains, losses flow through to grantor
- Grantor pays income taxes on trust earnings
- This is a **benefit**: Trust grows undiminished by taxes
- Grantor paying taxes = additional tax-free gift to beneficiaries

---

## Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT)

### The Problem

GRATs are generally **NOT GST-efficient**:
- Remainder interest valued at near-zero
- Can't efficiently allocate GST exemption
- If GRAT fails, GST exemption wasted

### Workaround

For multigenerational planning:
- Let GRAT pass to children
- Children can then transfer to subsequent generation
- Or use GRAT in combination with **dynasty trusts**

---

## Risks and Limitations

### 1. Mortality Risk

**If grantor dies during GRAT term:**
- Most or all assets pulled back into estate
- Estate tax due on included assets
- Strategy fails

**Mitigation:** Shorter terms, good health, consider life insurance

### 2. Underperformance Risk

**If assets don't beat hurdle rate:**
- GRAT simply returns assets to grantor via annuity
- No wealth transferred to beneficiaries
- Administrative costs incurred for nothing
- But: **No harm done** — assets return to grantor

### 3. Regulatory Risk

**Proposed legislation has targeted GRATs:**
- Minimum 10-year term proposals
- Minimum remainder value requirements
- Prohibition on zeroed-out GRATs
- None enacted yet, but risk exists

### 4. Interest Rate Risk

Rising rates make GRATs less effective:
- Higher hurdle = harder to beat
- May need to wait for more favorable rate environment

## GRAT vs. Other Wealth Transfer Tools

| Strategy | Gift Tax Impact | Estate Tax Benefit | Liquidity | Complexity |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| **GRAT** | Minimal (zeroed) | Appreciation excluded | Annuity to grantor | Medium |
| **IDGT** | Uses exemption | All growth excluded | Sale proceeds | High |
| **Family LP/LLC** | Uses exemption (discounted) | Discounted transfer | Varies | High |
| **CRT** | Deduction | Removed from estate | Income stream | High |
| **Outright Gift** | Uses exemption | Full value excluded | None | Low |

## Step-by-Step GRAT Implementation

### 1. Planning Phase
- Identify assets with high growth potential
- Assess mortality risk (grantor's health/age)
- Determine term length and payment structure
- Check current 7520 rate
- Consult estate planning attorney

### 2. Trust Creation
- Draft GRAT document (irrevocable)
- Name trustee (often grantor or family member)
- Specify beneficiaries
- Define annuity payment schedule

### 3. Funding
- Transfer assets to GRAT
- Obtain appraisals if needed (closely-held assets)
- Document fair market values

### 4. Ongoing Administration
- Make annual annuity payments to grantor
- File trust tax return (flows through to grantor's 1040)
- Monitor asset performance
- Consider substitutions if appropriate

### 5. Termination
- At term end, remaining assets distributed to beneficiaries
- No additional gift tax if properly structured
- Assets now outside grantor's estate

---

## Mathematical Example

### Setup
- Grantor transfers $10 million to GRAT
- 2-year term, zeroed-out structure
- 7520 rate: 5.0%
- Graduated payments (20% increase year 2)

### Annuity Calculation
To zero out, present value of annuity must equal $10M:
- Year 1 payment: ~$5.4M
- Year 2 payment: ~$6.5M (Year 1 × 1.2)
- Total returned to grantor: ~$11.9M

### If Assets Appreciate 15% Annually
- Year 1 ending value: $11.5M (after $5.4M distribution = $6.1M remains)
- Year 2 ending value: $7.0M → $8.05M → $1.55M after final distribution
- **$1.55M passes to beneficiaries tax-free**

### If Assets Only Match Hurdle Rate (5%)
- Year 1: $10.5M - $5.4M = $5.1M
- Year 2: $5.36M - $6.5M = near $0
- Virtually nothing passes to beneficiaries
- But grantor received all assets back — no harm

## Advanced Strategies

### 1. Upstream GRAT (for Parents)

Elderly parents with appreciated assets:
- Parent creates GRAT with children as beneficiaries
- If parent survives, appreciation passes tax-free
- If parent dies, assets included in estate (stepped-up basis)
- Win-win in either scenario

### 2. GRAT + IDGT Combination

- GRAT for assets with near-term appreciation catalyst
- IDGT sale for longer-term growth assets
- Maximizes use of both techniques

### 3. GRAT + Life Insurance

Purchase life insurance to hedge mortality risk:
- If grantor dies during term, insurance proceeds available
- Often held in ILIT to keep proceeds out of estate

---

## When NOT to Use a GRAT

1. **Poor health** — High mortality risk makes GRAT inadvisable
2. **Low-growth assets** — Won't beat hurdle rate
3. **Short time horizon** — Need assets for personal use
4. **Simple estate** — Below exemption threshold, GRAT unnecessary
5. **High interest rate environment** — Difficult hurdle rate

---

## 2026 Planning Considerations

### OBBBA Extended Exemptions

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, estate exemptions:
- Continue at elevated levels (~$15M/person in 2026)
- Indexed for inflation going forward
- Removes immediate sunset urgency

### GRATs Still Valuable When:
- Estate exceeds exemption amount
- Assets have significant appreciation potential
- Want to transfer growth without using exemption
- Building dynasty-style wealth transfer strategy
