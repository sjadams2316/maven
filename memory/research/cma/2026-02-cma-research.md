## Executive Summary

This document compiles 10-year Capital Market Assumptions (CMAs) from leading investment research firms to support Pantheon's portfolio analysis features. The key finding is that **forward-looking expectations favor international equities over US**, despite historical returns heavily favoring US large caps.

### Key Insight: The Narrative Flip

| Asset Class | Historical 10yr | Expected 10yr |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| US Large Cap | ~13% | ~5% (3.1-6.7%) |
| International Developed | ~5% | ~6.5% (4.9-8.1%) |
| Emerging Markets | ~4% | ~7.8% (7.2-9.9%) |

This flip is critical for explaining diversification recommendations to users.

## Key Themes Across Sources

### 1. US Equity Valuations Are Stretched
All firms cite elevated valuations (CAPE ~35) as a headwind for US large cap returns. This is the primary driver of muted US equity expectations.

### 2. International Valuations More Attractive
Lower P/E ratios in developed international (CAPE ~18) and emerging markets suggest better forward returns. Multiple firms note potential dollar weakness would further boost USD returns.

### 3. Bonds Have Become Competitive
Starting yields of 4-5% support reasonable bond returns. Several firms (Vanguard, Research Affiliates) expect bonds to match or beat US large cap stocks over 10 years.

### 4. Small Cap and Value Favored Over Growth
Within US equities, firms consistently prefer small caps and value stocks over large cap growth due to valuation differentials.

### 5. Real Assets Opportunity
J.P. Morgan highlights a "generational opportunity" in real estate due to attractive entry points post-2022 correction.
