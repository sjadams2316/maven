## Executive Summary

Retirement account distributions require careful planning to minimize taxes, avoid penalties, and maximize wealth. This document covers **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)**, **72(t) Substantially Equal Periodic Payments (SEPP)** for early access, and **Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)** for tax-efficient charitable giving.

---

## 1. Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

### RMD Age Requirements (Post-SECURE 2.0)

| Birth Year | RMD Starting Age |
|------------|------------------|
| 1950 or earlier | 72 (already started) |
| 1951-1959 | 73 |
| 1960 or later | 75 |

### Required Beginning Date (RBD)

**Definition**: April 1 of the year following the year you reach RMD age

**Example (2025)**:
- Turn 73 in 2025 → RBD is April 1, 2026
- First RMD covers 2025 (can delay until April 1, 2026)
- Second RMD due by December 31, 2026
- **Warning**: Delaying first RMD means TWO RMDs in same tax year

### Accounts Subject to RMDs

| Account Type | RMDs Required? | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Traditional IRA | Yes | Starting at RMD age |
| 401(k)/403(b) | Yes | Can delay if still working at that employer |
| Roth IRA | No | During owner's lifetime (beneficiaries have RMDs) |
| Roth 401(k) | No | As of 2024, SECURE 2.0 eliminated Roth 401k RMDs |
| Inherited IRA | Yes | Rules depend on beneficiary type |
| SEP/SIMPLE IRA | Yes | Same as Traditional IRA |

### Still-Working Exception (401k/403b)

**If still employed at age 73+:**
- Can delay RMD from current employer's plan until retirement
- Does NOT apply if >5% owner
- Does NOT apply to IRAs
- Does NOT apply to plans from former employers

---

## 2. RMD Calculation

### The Formula

```
RMD = Account Balance (Dec 31 prior year) ÷ Life Expectancy Factor
```

### Uniform Lifetime Table (Table III) - Most Common

Used when: Spouse is NOT sole beneficiary OR spouse is <10 years younger

| Age | Factor | Age | Factor | Age | Factor |
|-----|--------|-----|--------|-----|--------|
| 73 | 26.5 | 80 | 20.2 | 87 | 14.4 |
| 74 | 25.5 | 81 | 19.4 | 88 | 13.7 |
| 75 | 24.6 | 82 | 18.5 | 89 | 12.9 |
| 76 | 23.7 | 83 | 17.7 | 90 | 12.2 |
| 77 | 22.9 | 84 | 16.8 | 91 | 11.5 |
| 78 | 22.0 | 85 | 16.0 | 92 | 10.8 |
| 79 | 21.1 | 86 | 15.2 | 93 | 10.1 |

*Source: IRS Publication 590-B (2025), Appendix B*

### Joint and Last Survivor Table (Table II)

Used when: Spouse is SOLE beneficiary AND is >10 years younger than you

**Advantage**: Lower RMD (longer life expectancy)

### Calculation Example

```
Facts:
- Age: 75
- IRA balance 12/31/2024: $500,000
- Spouse is 72 (within 10 years)

Calculation:
- Use Uniform Lifetime Table
- Factor for age 75: 24.6
- RMD = $500,000 ÷ 24.6 = $20,325
```

### Multiple Accounts

**IRAs**: Calculate each RMD separately; can take total from ANY combination of IRAs
**401(k)s**: Must take from EACH plan separately (no aggregation)

---

## 3. RMD Penalty for Failure to Take

### Pre-2023 Penalty: 50%
### 2023 Forward (SECURE 2.0): 25%
### If Corrected Timely: 10%

**Timely Correction**:
- File Form 5329
- Take corrective distribution
- Do so within 2 years of original due date (or by end of correction window)

---

## 4. 72(t) SEPP - Early Access Without Penalty

### What Is 72(t) SEPP?

**IRC Section 72(t)(2)(A)(iv)** exempts "substantially equal periodic payments" from the 10% early withdrawal penalty (before age 59½).

### Requirements

1. **Payments must continue** for the LONGER of:
   - 5 years, OR
   - Until age 59½
2. **No modifications** during that period
3. **IRA-based**: Works best with IRAs (401k requires separation from service)
4. **Account-specific**: Each SEPP tied to specific account

### SEPP Duration Example

| Start Age | End of SEPP | Duration |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 50 | 59½ | 9.5 years |
| 55 | 60 | 5 years |
| 57 | 62 | 5 years |
| 58 | 63 | 5 years |

### Three Approved Calculation Methods

**1. Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) Method**
- Recalculates each year
- Most conservative (lowest payment)
- Fluctuates with account balance

```
Formula: Account Balance ÷ Life Expectancy Factor

Example: $1,000,000 ÷ 36.2 (age 50) = $27,624/year
```

**2. Fixed Amortization Method**
- Fixed amount over life expectancy
- Uses interest rate (≤5% or 120% of mid-term AFR)
- Higher payments than RMD method

```
Formula: Amortization of account balance over life expectancy at chosen rate

Example: $1,000,000 amortized at 4% over 36.2 years = $52,797/year
```

**3. Fixed Annuitization Method**
- Fixed amount using annuity factor
- Highest payments
- Uses mortality tables

```
Formula: Account Balance ÷ Annuity Factor (from Table 4)

Example: $1,000,000 ÷ 18.1568 = $55,075/year
```

### One-Time Switch Allowed

**Can switch once** from Fixed Amortization or Fixed Annuitization to RMD Method
- Useful if payments become burdensome
- Cannot switch TO a fixed method
- Not considered a modification

### Penalty for Modification

**If modified before end of SEPP period**:
- 10% penalty on ALL distributions taken under SEPP
- Plus interest from original distribution dates
- Applies retroactively

### 72(t) Planning Tips

1. **Segregate Funds**: Move only needed amount to SEPP IRA; keep rest in separate account
2. **Conservative Rate**: Use lower interest rate for flexibility
3. **Document Everything**: Keep calculation records
4. **No Additions**: Can't add to SEPP account after payments begin
5. **Consider Multiple SEPPs**: Can have different SEPPs from different IRAs

## 5. Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)

### What Is a QCD?

Direct transfer from IRA to qualified charity that:
- Counts toward RMD (if applicable)
- Excludes distribution from taxable income
- Provides charitable benefit without itemizing

### 2025-2026 QCD Rules

| Rule | 2025 Amount | 2026 Amount |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Maximum Annual QCD** | $108,000 per person | $111,000 per person |
| **Married Couple Max** | $216,000 combined | $222,000 combined |
| **One-Time Split-Interest** | $54,000 (lifetime) | $55,000 (indexed) |
| **Minimum Age** | 70½ | 70½ (unchanged) |
| **Account Types** | IRA, Roth IRA, inactive SEP/SIMPLE | Same |
| **NOT Eligible** | 401(k), 403(b), active SEP/SIMPLE | Same |

**Critical Note**: QCD age (70½) has NOT changed, even though RMD age is now 73. You can do QCDs for 2.5 years before RMDs begin!

### Why QCDs Are Powerful

**Standard Deduction Comparison**:
```
Without QCD (standard deduction taxpayer):
- RMD: $50,000 → taxable income
- Donation: $10,000 → no deduction (doesn't itemize)
- Net taxable income: $50,000

With QCD:
- RMD: $50,000, but $10,000 via QCD
- Taxable income: $40,000
- Same charitable result, $10,000 less taxable income
```

### QCD Requirements

1. **Direct Transfer**: Must go directly from IRA custodian to charity
2. **Qualified Charity**: 501(c)(3); NOT donor-advised funds, private foundations
3. **Age 70½+**: QCD age has NOT changed (unlike RMD age)
4. **Taxable Portion Only**: QCDs apply to taxable amounts
5. **Documentation**: Get written acknowledgment from charity

### QCD and RMD Interaction

**QCDs count toward RMD satisfaction**:
```
Example:
- RMD requirement: $30,000
- QCD made: $25,000
- Additional withdrawal needed: $5,000
- Taxable income: $5,000 (not $30,000)
```

### One-Time QCD to Split-Interest Entity

**SECURE 2.0 Addition**: One-time $54,000 QCD (indexed) to:
- Charitable Remainder Trust
- Charitable Gift Annuity

This is a **lifetime limit** per taxpayer.

### QCD Offset for Post-70½ IRA Contributions

If you made **deductible IRA contributions after age 70½**, your QCD benefit is reduced:

```
QCD Adjustment = Lesser of:
- Total post-70½ deductible contributions, OR
- Aggregate QCDs for year

This amount is ADDED BACK to taxable income
```

### 2025 Form 1099-R Reporting

**New for 2025**: Code Y in Box 7 specifically identifies QCDs
- Makes reporting cleaner
- Still report full distribution on 1040, then exclude QCD portion

## 6. Coordinated Distribution Strategy

### Optimal Sequencing by Account Type

**General Framework (varies by situation):**

| Sequence | Account Type | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | Taxable accounts | Lowest tax drag; step-up potential |
| 2 | Tax-deferred (Traditional) | Take strategic Roth conversions |
| 3 | Tax-free (Roth) | Last resort; maximize tax-free growth |

### Tax Bracket Management

**Goal**: Fill lower brackets each year to minimize lifetime taxes

```
Example (2025 MFJ):
- Social Security: $40,000 (85% taxable = $34,000)
- Target: Fill 22% bracket (up to $201,050)
- Space available: $167,050

Strategy:
- Take $50,000 RMD (required)
- Convert additional $117,050 to Roth
- Total: $201,050 (top of 22% bracket)
```

### QCD + RMD + Roth Conversion Coordination

**Optimal Order:**
1. Satisfy RMD with QCDs first (if charitably inclined)
2. Take remaining RMD
3. Evaluate Roth conversion to fill bracket

```
Example:
- RMD: $50,000
- QCD: $30,000 (satisfies part of RMD, tax-free)
- Taxable RMD: $20,000
- Roth conversion: $90,000 (fill 22% bracket)
- Charity receives $30,000; Roth grows $90,000
```

## 7. Summary Decision Framework

### When to Use Each Strategy

| Strategy | Best For | Avoid When |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Standard RMD** | Normal retirement spending | - |
| **QCD** | Charitably inclined; standard deduction | Not meeting age 70½; need income |
| **72(t) SEPP** | Early retirement before 59½; substantial IRA | May need to change payments; small balance |
| **Roth Conversion** | Low-income years; estate planning | Already in high bracket; need liquidity |

### Annual Distribution Review Checklist
