## Executive Summary

Exchange funds (also called "swap funds") allow investors to diversify concentrated stock positions without triggering immediate capital gains taxes. By pooling appreciated stock with other investors in a partnership structure, participants receive diversification on day one while deferring taxes until they exit. This is a key strategy for HNW clients with low-basis stock from compensation, inheritances, or long-held investments.

## 1. What Is an Exchange Fund?

### Definition

An exchange fund is a **pooled investment vehicle structured as a partnership** where multiple investors contribute their concentrated stock positions in-kind. In return, each participant receives partnership units representing a proportional share of the diversified portfolio.

### Key Characteristics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Limited partnership (LP) or LLC |
| **Tax Treatment** | IRC Section 721 - no gain recognized on contribution |
| **Holding Period** | Minimum 7 years required |
| **Exit** | Receive basket of diversified securities (not cash) |
| **Basis** | Carries over from contributed stock |

## 2. How Exchange Funds Work

### Step-by-Step Process

```
1. CONTRIBUTION
   Investor contributes $1M of Apple stock (cost basis: $100K)
   → No capital gains tax triggered
   → Receives partnership units

2. POOLING
   Fund aggregates stock from many investors
   → Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.
   → Creates diversified portfolio across sectors

3. HOLDING PERIOD (7 years minimum)
   Partnership manages the diversified pool
   → Investor is diversified from Day 1
   → Can't withdraw early

4. EXIT (after 7 years)
   Investor receives pro-rata share of portfolio
   → Basket of stocks OR ETFs
   → NOT the same stock they contributed
   → Still carry-over basis (tax deferred)

5. EVENTUAL SALE
   Investor sells distributed securities
   → NOW capital gains are recognized
   → Or hold until death for step-up basis
```

### Tax Mechanics

**Why No Tax on Contribution?**

IRC Section 721(a): "No gain or loss shall be recognized to a partnership or to any of its partners in the case of a contribution of property to the partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership."

**Why 7-Year Holding Period?**

To avoid recognition under:
- Section 704(c)(1)(B): 7-year lookback on distributions of contributed property
- Section 737: 7-year lookback on distribution of other property
- Section 707(a)(2)(B): 2-year presumption of disguised sales

After 7 years, distributions of a diversified basket do NOT trigger gain recognition.

## 3. The 20% Real Estate Requirement

### IRS Anti-Abuse Rule

To prevent exchange funds from being treated as "investment companies" under Section 721(b), they must hold at least **20% of assets in non-marketable securities**.

**Typical Solution**: Real estate holdings (often commercial properties)

**Impact on Returns**:
- Real estate allocation may not match investor's desired asset allocation
- Management fees higher to cover RE administration
- Returns may differ from pure equity index

---

## 4. Who Are Exchange Funds For?

### Ideal Candidate Profile

| Characteristic | Requirement |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Accredited Investor** | SEC requirement (private placement) |
| **Minimum Investment** | Typically $500K-$1M+ |
| **Low Basis Stock** | Significant unrealized gain |
| **7+ Year Horizon** | Can afford to lock up capital |
| **Diversification Need** | >10% of portfolio in single stock |

### Typical Users

1. **Corporate executives** with stock compensation
2. **Founders** post-IPO with concentrated holdings
3. **Long-term investors** with highly appreciated positions
4. **Heirs** who inherited low-basis stock
5. **Employees** from successful startups (RSUs, options)

---

## 5. Major Exchange Fund Providers

| Provider | Minimum | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Cache** | ~$100K | Tech-focused, lower minimums |
| **Goldman Sachs** | $1M+ | Traditional, established |
| **Eaton Vance** | $500K+ | Long track record |
| **Morgan Stanley** | $1M+ | Full-service |

## 6. Advantages of Exchange Funds

### Tax Benefits

1. **Immediate diversification** without capital gains tax
2. **Tax deferral** until eventual sale of distributed securities
3. **Step-up basis** potential if held until death
4. **Convert single-stock risk** to market risk

### Risk Management

1. **Sector diversification**: Reduce company-specific risk
2. **Index-like exposure**: Post-exit portfolio mimics broad market
3. **No margin calls**: Unlike hedging strategies
4. **Predictable outcome**: Know you'll receive diversified basket

### Compared to Alternatives

| Alternative | Disadvantage |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Outright Sale** | Triggers immediate capital gains |
| **Hedging (Puts)** | Premium cost, complexity, renewal risk |
| **Charitable Giving** | No longer own the asset |
| **Direct Indexing** | Slow diversification through harvesting |

---

## 7. Disadvantages and Risks

### Liquidity

- **7-year lock-up**: Can't access capital
- **Early exit**: Only receive back your original stock (at lower of original or current value)
- **No secondary market**: Partnership units aren't tradeable

### Costs

- **Management fees**: 0.75%-1.5% annually
- **Real estate costs**: Administration, maintenance
- **Fund expenses**: Legal, accounting, etc.

### Outcome Uncertainty

- **Different exit basket**: Won't get back your original stock
- **Market risk**: 7 years of equity volatility
- **RE allocation**: 20% in real estate may not be desired

### Concentration Risk Transfer

- You're diversified, but inherit **basis from all contributors**
- Your low-basis Apple becomes part of a pool with other low-basis stocks
- Tax liability is deferred, not eliminated

---

## 8. Tax Planning Considerations

### Basis Allocation at Exit

When you receive the diversified basket after 7 years:
- Basis is allocated across distributed securities
- Formula based on original contribution's basis and pro-rata share
- Detailed K-1 reporting

### Step-Up Basis Strategy

**Option**: Hold partnership units until death
- Heirs receive step-up in basis
- Permanently eliminates deferred gain
- Estate planning consideration

### Compared to CRT

| Feature | Exchange Fund | CRT |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Tax Deferral** | Full, until sale | Spread over trust term |
| **Asset Access** | After 7 years | Income stream only |
| **Estate Benefit** | Step-up at death | Charity receives remainder |
| **Complexity** | Moderate | High |

---

## 9. Exchange Fund vs. Direct Indexing

### When Each Works Better

**Exchange Fund Better When**:
- Very large unrealized gain (>50% appreciation)
- Can commit to 7-year horizon
- Need immediate diversification
- Don't want ongoing management decisions

**Direct Indexing Better When**:
- Shorter time horizon
- Need ongoing liquidity
- Want customization (ESG, factor tilts)
- Smaller concentrated position

---

## 10. Maven Integration Points

### For Concentrated Position Optimizer

**Evaluate Exchange Fund Suitability**:
1. Calculate unrealized gain percentage
2. Check investment minimum eligibility
3. Assess liquidity needs over 7 years
4. Compare to direct indexing tax efficiency
5. Model step-up vs. lifetime sale scenarios

### Decision Framework

```
IF unrealized_gain > 50% AND
   investment_amount > $500K AND
   time_horizon > 7_years AND
   liquidity_needs_met THEN
   → Consider exchange fund

ELSE IF moderate_gain AND need_liquidity THEN
   → Consider direct indexing

ELSE IF charitable_intent AND estate_planning THEN
   → Consider CRT or DAF
```

### Key Data Points Needed

- Cost basis of concentrated position
- Current market value
- Expected holding period
- Liquidity requirements
- Estate planning goals
- Risk tolerance

## 11. Regulatory and Compliance Notes
