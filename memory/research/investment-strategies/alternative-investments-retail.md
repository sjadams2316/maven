# Alternative Investments for Retail Investors: Maven's Perspective

*Research Date: February 2026*
*Status: Comprehensive Analysis*

---

## Executive Summary

Alternative investments are going mainstream. What was once the exclusive domain of institutions and ultra-high-net-worth individuals is increasingly accessible to retail investors through innovative fund structures, regulatory changes, and technology platforms. This represents both opportunity and risk for Maven users.

**Key Findings:**
- Retail allocations to private capital projected to surge from $80B to **$2.4 trillion by 2030** in the US
- SEC has eliminated informal rules limiting retail access to funds with >15% private assets
- New structures (interval funds, BDCs, defined-outcome ETFs) democratize access
- Fee layering, liquidity constraints, and valuation opacity remain significant concerns
- **Maven's Position:** Recommend alternatives selectively, with heavy emphasis on investor education and suitability

---

## 1. Interval Funds

### What They Are
Interval funds are closed-end investment companies registered under the 1940 Act that:
- Offer shares continuously at NAV (like mutual funds)
- Repurchase shares only at set intervals (quarterly, semi-annually, or annually)
- Repurchase offers typically range from **5-25% of outstanding shares**
- Can hold up to **95% of portfolio in illiquid assets** (vs 15% for open-end funds)

### Investment Focus
- Private credit
- Private real estate
- Infrastructure
- Hedge fund strategies
- Private equity (increasingly)

### Pros
| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Access to illiquid assets | Exposure to strategies unavailable in daily-liquid funds |
| Potentially higher returns | "Illiquidity premium" from less liquid investments |
| Lower volatility in reported NAV | Valuations based on estimates, not daily market prices |
| Lower minimums | Many start at $1,000-$50,000 vs $250K+ for private funds |
| No accreditation required | Most registered interval funds open to all investors |
| Regulated | SEC registration provides disclosure requirements |

### Cons
| Risk | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Limited liquidity** | Can only exit at intervals; may not get full redemption if oversubscribed |
| **Higher fees** | Average expense ratio ~1.5-3%+, plus repurchase fees up to 2% |
| **Valuation concerns** | NAV based on estimates, may not reflect true market value |
| **Illiquidity mismatch** | Retail investors may not appreciate lock-up implications |
| **Complexity** | Distribution rates vs. total returns often misunderstood |

### Market Size & Growth
- As of December 2024: **118 interval funds with $99 billion in assets**
- Year-over-year net asset growth: **29%**

### Key Warning from Harvard Research
> "Private BDCs sold only to wealthier individuals have **68 basis points higher quarterly returns** than non-traded products sold more broadly to retail investors. Less wealthy investors may be systematically sold inferior products."

### Maven Recommendation
⚠️ **Proceed with caution.** Interval funds can be appropriate for:
- Investors with 5+ year time horizons
- Those who understand they cannot access their money on demand
- Portfolios where this represents <10-15% of total liquid investments

**Red flags to watch:** Distribution rates that include return of capital, high fee layering, concentrated strategies.

---

## 2. Private Credit Funds (Retail Access)

### Market Context
- Private credit market reached **~$2 trillion AUM in 2024**
- High-net-worth and retail investors becoming increasingly important capital sources
- SEC Chair Atkins (May 2025) signaled expanded retail access

### Access Vehicles for Retail

#### Business Development Companies (BDCs)
- Regulated entities that lend to middle-market companies
- **162 BDCs with $225 billion in total net assets** (Dec 2024)
- Publicly traded BDCs offer daily liquidity
- Non-traded BDCs offer periodic repurchases

**BDC Characteristics:**
- Must invest 70%+ in "qualifying assets" (US private/small public companies)
- Yield-focused, often pay high distributions
- Leverage limited to 2:1 debt-to-equity

#### Private Credit ETFs
New entrants in 2024-2025:
- BondBloxx private credit ETF
- Virtus private credit ETF
- State Street actively managed private credit ETF

**ETF Advantages:** Daily liquidity, transparent pricing, lower minimums

#### Interval Funds Focused on Credit
Many interval funds focus heavily on private credit (direct lending, mezzanine, specialty finance).

### Risk Considerations

1. **Credit risk:** Loans to middle-market companies have higher default risk
2. **Interest rate sensitivity:** Floating-rate loans protect against rising rates but borrowers may struggle
3. **Valuation opacity:** Mark-to-model pricing may smooth volatility artificially
4. **Manager selection critical:** Wide performance dispersion between managers

### Maven Recommendation
✅ **Private credit can be appropriate** as a portfolio diversifier for income-oriented investors, but:
- Prefer **publicly traded BDCs** for liquidity
- Watch for fee layering in non-traded products
- Understand that "low volatility" is often an artifact of illiquid pricing

## 3. Real Estate: REITs vs Private Funds vs Crowdfunding

### Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Public REITs | Non-Traded REITs | Private RE Funds | Crowdfunding |
|---------|-------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Liquidity** | Daily (traded) | Limited (periodic) | Very limited | Very limited |
| **Minimum** | Share price | $1,000-$25,000 | $25,000-$250,000+ | $500-$10,000 |
| **Accreditation** | No | Usually no | Usually yes | Varies |
| **Fees** | Low (0.1-1%) | High (1-3%+) | High (2/20+) | Moderate-High |
| **Volatility** | High (market-linked) | Low (NAV-based) | Low (appraisal-based) | Low |
| **Transparency** | High | Moderate | Low | Moderate |
| **Tax efficiency** | Dividends taxable | Similar | K-1 complexity | Varies |

### Public REITs
**Pros:**
- Immediate liquidity
- Transparent pricing
- Low costs
- Dividend income

**Cons:**
- Correlated with stock market
- Can trade at premium/discount to NAV
- Volatility may not reflect underlying real estate

### Non-Traded REITs
**Pros:**
- Lower reported volatility
- Access to institutional-quality properties
- Income focus

**Cons:**
- High fees (often 8-15% upfront historically, though improving)
- Limited liquidity
- NAV may not reflect true value
- Historical scandals in this space

### Real Estate Crowdfunding (Fundrise, CrowdStreet)

#### Fundrise
- **Minimum:** $10
- **Accreditation:** Not required for most products
- **Fees:** 0.85% annual management (real estate), 0.15% advisory
- **Products:** eREITs, eFunds, Innovation Fund (venture)
- **Liquidity:** Can withdraw anytime but may face 1% penalty
- **Target returns:** 8-12% historically

**Strengths:** Low minimum, accessible, transparent tracking
**Weaknesses:** Illiquid underlying assets, limited control

#### CrowdStreet
- **Minimum:** $25,000
- **Accreditation:** Required
- **Focus:** Commercial real estate deals
- **Liquidity:** Very limited

**Note:** CrowdStreet faced challenges after a sponsor (Nightingale Properties) defaulted, highlighting platform risk.

### Maven Recommendation
| Investor Type | Best Fit |
|--------------|----------|
| Liquidity needed | Public REITs via low-cost ETF |
| Long-term holder, income focus | Fundrise or similar platform |
| Accredited, sophisticated | Private RE funds or direct deals |
| New investor | Public REIT index fund only |

---

## 4. Farmland (AcreTrader, FarmTogether)

### Why Farmland?
- **Historical returns:** ~11% average annual return over 30 years
- Low correlation to stocks/bonds
- Inflation hedge
- Growing global food demand
- "They're not making any more land" thesis

### Platform Comparison

| Feature | AcreTrader | FarmTogether |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Minimum** | $15,000 | $15,000-$3M |
| **Accreditation** | Required | Required |
| **Fee structure** | 2% initial + 0.75% annual + 5% sale | 2% initial + 1-2% annual + 0.75-5% NOI |
| **Deal acceptance rate** | >5% | ~0.4% |
| **Focus** | Row crops primarily | Permanent crops primarily |
| **Expected returns** | 3-5% cash yield | 6-13% |
| **Liquidity** | Annual window | Limited |
| **Due diligence** | Strong | Very strong (105-point checklist) |

### Other Farmland Options
- **Farmland Partners ($FPI):** Publicly traded REIT, ~180K acres
- **Gladstone Land ($LAND):** Publicly traded REIT, ~115K acres
- **Steward:** Regenerative farm loans, $100 minimum, non-accredited

### Risk Considerations
- **Illiquidity:** 7-10+ year hold periods typical
- **Concentration risk:** Weather, commodity prices, regional issues
- **Accreditation barrier:** Most platforms require accredited status
- **Operational risk:** Platform/sponsor risk

### Maven Recommendation
🌾 **Farmland makes sense for diversified portfolios** where:
- Investor has 10+ year horizon
- Portfolio is already well-diversified
- Investor is accredited
- Allocation is <5-10% of portfolio

For non-accredited: Consider **$FPI or $LAND** for liquid farmland exposure.

## 5. Private Equity Access Platforms

### Fundrise Innovation Fund
- Invests in pre-IPO tech companies (AI, data infrastructure)
- **Minimum:** $10 (within Fundrise account)
- **Fee:** 1.85% flat annual management
- **Accreditation:** Not required
- Long-term appreciation focus

### Yieldstreet
- Multi-asset alternative platform
- **Minimum:** $10,000
- **Fees:** 0-2.5% depending on investment
- **Asset classes:** Real estate, art, legal settlements, short-term notes, private credit
- **Accreditation:** Non-accredited can only access Alternative Income Fund
- Highly illiquid investments

### iCapital, CAIS
- Platforms serving financial advisors
- Access to institutional private equity and hedge funds
- Higher minimums, accredited/qualified purchaser requirements

### Key Concerns
1. **Fee layering:** Platform fee + underlying fund fee + performance fee
2. **Vintage year risk:** Private equity returns vary significantly by deployment timing
3. **J-curve:** Early negative returns before value creation
4. **Access vs. quality:** Retail may get access to lower-tier funds

### Maven Recommendation
⚠️ **Approach with skepticism.** Most retail investors are better served by:
- Public market small-cap value exposure
- Listed private equity ETFs (if available)
- Patience for IPOs of companies they want to own

If pursuing private equity access, prefer platforms with:
- Track record of realized returns (not just IRR estimates)
- Transparent fee disclosure
- Proper diversification across vintages

## 6. Structured Products

### Evolution: From Notes to ETFs

#### Traditional Structured Notes
- Debt instruments with payoffs tied to underlying assets
- Issued by major banks (JPM, Goldman, etc.)
- **Risks:** Issuer credit risk, complexity, illiquidity, obscure pricing

#### Buffered ETFs (Defined Outcome ETFs)
**Market Size:** ~$43.4 billion AUM (May 2025), growing rapidly

**How They Work:**
- Use options strategies to provide downside "buffer" (e.g., first 10-15% losses absorbed)
- Cap upside participation (typically 8-15% annually)
- Reset annually with new outcome periods

**Key Players:** Innovator ETFs, First Trust, TrueShares

**Example:**
- S&P 500 Buffer ETF with 10% buffer, 12% cap
- If S&P drops 8%, you lose 0%
- If S&P drops 20%, you lose 10%
- If S&P gains 20%, you gain 12% (capped)

#### Covered Call ETFs
- Hold underlying stocks + sell calls against them
- Generate income, sacrifice upside
- ~$75.2 billion AUM
- Popular in low-rate environments

### Comparison

| Factor | Structured Notes | Buffered ETFs |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Customization | High | Standardized |
| Liquidity | Low | High (traded) |
| Transparency | Low | High |
| Credit risk | Issuer-dependent | Diversified |
| Complexity | Very high | Moderate |

### Maven Recommendation
✅ **Buffered ETFs can be appropriate** for:
- Near-retirees seeking downside protection
- Risk-averse investors wanting equity exposure
- Portfolio insurance allocation

❌ **Avoid traditional structured notes** for most retail investors due to:
- Complexity
- Hidden fees
- Illiquidity
- Issuer credit risk

## 7. Due Diligence Requirements

### For Advisors/Platforms Recommending Alternatives

**SEC/Regulatory Expectations:**
- Clear, plain-English disclosure of fees (including fee layering)
- Liquidity limitations explained prominently
- Valuation methodology transparency
- Conflicts of interest disclosed
- Suitability determination documented

### Investor Due Diligence Checklist

#### Before Investing in Any Alternative:

1. **Understand the fee structure completely**
   - [ ] Management fee
   - [ ] Performance/incentive fees
   - [ ] Underlying fund fees (if fund-of-funds)
   - [ ] Transaction/repurchase fees
   - [ ] Platform fees

2. **Assess liquidity realistically**
   - [ ] How long until I can access my money?
   - [ ] What happens if I need funds early?
   - [ ] What's the penalty for early exit?
   - [ ] What if redemptions are oversubscribed?

3. **Evaluate the manager**
   - [ ] Track record (audited, realized returns)
   - [ ] AUM and fund stability
   - [ ] Team experience
   - [ ] SEC registration/regulatory history

4. **Understand valuation methodology**
   - [ ] How are assets valued?
   - [ ] How often?
   - [ ] By whom (independent third party)?
   - [ ] What happens in market stress?

5. **Tax implications**
   - [ ] K-1 vs 1099?
   - [ ] UBTI concerns for IRAs?
   - [ ] State tax implications?

### Accredited Investor Status (2025)

**Qualification Methods:**
- Income: $200,000+ individual / $300,000+ joint for past 2 years
- Net worth: $1,000,000+ excluding primary residence
- Professional certifications: Series 7, 65, 82

## 8. Liquidity Considerations

### The Liquidity Hierarchy

```
Most Liquid ←────────────────────────────→ Least Liquid

Public      Public    Buffered   Interval   Tender    Non-traded   Private
Stocks/     REITs/    ETFs       Funds      Offer     REITs/BDCs   Funds
ETFs        BDCs                            Funds
```

### Liquidity Risk Framework

| Vehicle | Normal Liquidity | Stress Liquidity | Redemption Risk |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Public REIT | Daily | Daily (possible NAV discount) | Low |
| Interval Fund | Quarterly (5-25%) | May be capped | Medium-High |
| Tender Offer Fund | Discretionary | May be suspended | High |
| Non-traded REIT | Monthly-Quarterly | May be suspended | High |
| Crowdfunding | Very limited | Near zero | Very High |
| Private Fund | Quarterly+ | May be gated | Very High |

### What Happens in a Crisis?

**Historical Examples:**
- 2008-2009: Many non-traded REITs suspended redemptions
- 2020 (COVID): Some interval funds reduced redemption offers
- 2022 (Blackstone BREIT): Limited redemptions when requests exceeded capacity

**Key Lesson:** The liquidity you need most is the liquidity least likely to be available.

### Maven's Liquidity Rule
> **Never invest more in illiquid alternatives than you could afford to lose or lock up for 10+ years.** The stress-test question: "Would I panic if this went to zero and I couldn't sell it?"

## 9. Should Maven Recommend Alternatives? When?

### Maven's Framework for Alternative Recommendations

#### ✅ YES, Recommend When:

1. **Investor Profile Matches**
   - Time horizon: 7+ years
   - Liquid emergency fund: 6+ months established
   - Core portfolio: Diversified stocks/bonds already in place
   - Risk tolerance: Understands and accepts illiquidity
   - Tax situation: Can handle K-1 complexity or use tax-advantaged accounts appropriately

2. **Portfolio Fit**
   - Alternatives allocation: ≤15% of total portfolio
   - Specific purpose: Diversification, income, or inflation hedge
   - Not replacing: Core equity or fixed income exposure

3. **Product Quality**
   - Established manager/platform
   - Transparent fees (total cost <2% annually ideal)
   - Clear liquidity terms
   - Track record of realized (not estimated) returns

#### ❌ NO, Don't Recommend When:

1. **Investor Red Flags**
   - May need funds within 5 years
   - No emergency savings
   - Chasing yield/returns without understanding risks
   - Limited investment experience
   - Cannot meet accreditation requirements (for products requiring it)

2. **Product Red Flags**
   - Fee layering exceeding 2.5-3%+ annually
   - Distribution rate includes significant return of capital
   - New/unproven manager or platform
   - Concentrated strategy (single property, sector, vintage)
   - Vague or unavailable liquidity terms

3. **Suitability Concerns**
   - Investor doesn't understand what they're buying
   - Driven by FOMO or fear of missing institutional access
   - Expects liquid-market-like behavior from illiquid products

### Maven's Recommended Alternative Allocation by Investor Type

| Investor Type | Max Alternatives % | Preferred Vehicles |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Young accumulator | 0-5% | None until core established; maybe Fundrise |
| Mid-career, accredited | 5-10% | Interval funds, BDCs, farmland platforms |
| High net worth | 10-15% | Diversified alts sleeve with professional guidance |
| Near-retirement | 0-10% | Buffered ETFs, income-focused BDCs only |
| Retiree | 0-5% | Avoid illiquid; income REITs/BDCs with liquidity |

### Maven's Key Messages to Users

1. **"Alternatives are a complement, not a replacement."**
   - Core portfolio of stocks/bonds should come first
   - Alternatives add diversification at the margin

2. **"Access ≠ Appropriateness."**
   - Just because you can invest doesn't mean you should
   - Institutional products aren't inherently better

3. **"Liquidity is a feature, not a bug."**
   - Paying for liquidity (through slightly lower returns) is often worth it
   - The illiquidity premium may not compensate for stress

4. **"Fees compound too."**
   - A 2.5% all-in fee is 10x a 0.25% index fund
   - Alternatives must meaningfully outperform to justify costs

5. **"Understand before you invest."**
   - If you can't explain how you'll exit and what it costs, don't invest
   - Read the prospectus/PPM; at minimum, the fee and liquidity sections
