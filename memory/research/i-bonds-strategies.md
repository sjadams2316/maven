# I-Bonds: The Underutilized Inflation Hedge
*Research compiled: 2026-02-05*

## The Alpha Most Advisors Miss

I-Bonds are one of the few guaranteed-to-beat-inflation investments available to retail investors. Most advisors dismiss them because of the $10,000 limit. Here's how to multiply that limit legally.

## What Makes I-Bonds Special

### The Rate Structure
I-Bonds pay: **Fixed Rate + Inflation Rate**

- **Fixed rate:** Set at purchase, never changes for life of bond
- **Inflation rate:** Adjusts every 6 months based on CPI-U

### The Deflation Protection (What Most Miss)

**Key Insight:** The composite rate can never go below zero. Your principal is guaranteed.

During deflation:
- If fixed rate > 0: You'll earn at least the fixed rate
- If fixed rate = 0: You'll earn 0% (still beat deflation)
- **Your principal can never decrease**

This is unique. TIPS can have negative total returns. I-Bonds cannot.

**Historical Edge:** In the 2009 deflation period, I-Bond holders with a 0% fixed rate earned 0% while prices fell 2%. They effectively gained 2% in purchasing power while their rate showed 0%.

## The $10,000 Limit "Workarounds"

### Method 1: Trust Purchases ($10,000 per trust)
Each trust can buy $10,000/year in its own TreasuryDirect account.

**Setup:**
1. If you have a revocable living trust → Open entity account at TreasuryDirect
2. No trust? Create one with software for ~$50-100
3. Same SSN works (trust uses grantor's SSN)
4. Same email and bank account can be used

**Scaling:**
- Joint trust = 1 account, $10,000/year
- Each spouse has separate trust = 2 accounts, $20,000/year
- Multiple trusts with different beneficiaries = $10,000 each

**Warning:** Each trust needs formal documentation. LegalZoom-style trusts work fine.

### Method 2: Business Entity Purchases ($10,000 per entity)
LLCs, corporations, sole proprietorships, and partnerships can each buy $10,000.

**Requirements:**
- Valid EIN
- Business must have legitimate purpose (not solely for I-Bond purchases)
- Separate TreasuryDirect entity account

### Method 3: Gift Purchases (Timing Arbitrage)
You can buy I-Bonds as gifts that sit in your "Gift Box" until delivered.

**The Strategy:**
1. Buy $10,000 in your name (hits your 2025 limit)
2. Buy $10,000 as gift to spouse (sits in your gift box)
3. Deliver gift in January 2026 (hits spouse's 2026 limit)

**Net Effect:** Effectively front-load future year purchases.

### ~~Method 4: Tax Refund (DISCONTINUED)~~
**As of January 31, 2025:** You can no longer use tax refunds to purchase paper I-Bonds.

This method is dead. Don't let clients waste time on it.

## Optimal Holding Period

### Minimum: 1 Year

### Penalty Zone: 1-5 Years
Forfeit last 3 months of interest if redeemed before 5 years.

### Sweet Spot: 5+ Years
No penalty. Full interest retained.

### Maximum: 30 Years
Bonds stop earning interest after 30 years.

**Strategy:** For true long-term inflation protection, hold 5+ years minimum.

## Education Tax Exclusion (The Forgotten Benefit)

I-Bonds can be cashed **tax-free** for qualified education expenses.

### Requirements
1. Bond owner must be 24+ years old at time of purchase
2. Proceeds used for qualified higher education expenses
3. MAGI below income limits:
   - **2025 Single:** $99,500 - $114,500 (phaseout)
   - **2025 MFJ:** $149,250 - $179,250 (phaseout)
4. Expenses for you, spouse, or dependent
5. Cannot file married filing separately

### Qualified Expenses
- Tuition and fees at eligible institutions
- Contributions to 529 plans (conversion strategy)

### The 529 Conversion Play
Cash I-Bonds → Deposit into 529 plan → Tax-free I-Bond interest + 529 benefits

**When to use:** High-income years where you might exceed MAGI limits later.

## Tax Deferral Option

You can defer I-Bond interest until:
- You cash the bond, OR
- The bond matures (30 years), OR
- You elect to report annually

**Most choose deferral.** 30 years of tax-deferred growth is valuable.

## Current Rates (Check TreasuryDirect for updates)

As of November 2025:
- **Fixed Rate:** 1.20%
- **Inflation Rate:** Variable (changes May/November)
- **Composite Rate:** Fixed + Inflation (calculated)

**Strategic Timing:** Fixed rate is locked at purchase. Buy when fixed rates are high.

## Mind-Blowing Fact for Clients

> "A married couple with a revocable trust can buy $40,000+ in I-Bonds annually, earning guaranteed inflation protection with zero credit risk.
