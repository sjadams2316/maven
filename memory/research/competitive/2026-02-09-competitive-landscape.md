# Competitive Intelligence: Wealth Management & Robo-Advisor Landscape

*Research Date: 2026-02-09*
*Prepared for: Project Pantheon (Maven)*

---

## Executive Summary

The wealth management/robo-advisor market is bifurcated:
1. **Traditional Robo-Advisors** (Betterment, Wealthfront, Schwab, Vanguard, Fidelity) — Manage money, charge AUM fees
2. **Financial Tracking Apps** (Copilot, Monarch, Mezzi) — Aggregate data, provide insights, subscription-based

**Maven's unique position:** AI-native analysis tool that provides institutional-grade insights WITHOUT managing money or charging AUM fees. This is a significant whitespace opportunity.
