   - Firms struggle to build brand loyalty beyond individual relationships
   - High advisor turnover creates client attrition risk

2. **Fee Transparency**

## 6. Why Clients Leave

### Primary Drivers of Client Attrition

**1. Advisor Departure (Top Reason)**
- 63% of clients would follow their advisor to a new firm
- Relationship is with the person, not the institution
- Trust built over years transfers with the advisor

**2. Life Events**

- Sale of business creates new needs
- Inheritance requires specialized advice
- Marriage/divorce changes financial picture
- Health events shift priorities

**3. UHNW Clients Most Likely to Leave**
- 39% of UHNW clients plan to switch providers in next 3 years (EY)
- Compared to 27% of HNW and 32% of mass affluent
- UHNW clients diversify across multiple providers
- Higher expectations for performance and personalization

**4. Generational Wealth Transfer**

- Different communication preferences (digital, social media)
- 44% of self-directed clients expect digital tools to help meet goals
- $84 trillion wealth transfer expected by 2045 (Cerulli)

**5. Sustainability/ESG Misalignment**

2. **Proactive Communication**: Anticipating needs before clients articulate them
3. **Integrated Services**: One-stop shop for banking, investing, lending, planning

## 7. Lending as Competitive Advantage

### Securities-Based Lending (SBLOC) Overview

Securities-based lending has become "Wall Street's hottest business" and a critical differentiator for private banks. SBLOCs allow clients to borrow against their investment portfolios without liquidating securities.

### How It Works
- Revolving line of credit secured by portfolio assets
- Borrow 50-95% of portfolio value (depending on asset types)
- Interest-only payments; principal repaid at borrower's discretion
- Cannot be used to purchase securities (non-purpose loan)

### Typical Rate Structure (2024-2025)
- SOFR + spread (typically 1-3%)
- Rates decrease with larger loan amounts
- JPM: "Very competitive" - fixed % plus SOFR, lending value 50-60% of most assets

### Why Banks Push SBLOCs

1. **Revenue Generation**: Cross-sell banking products, add revenue streams
2. **Client Retention**: Assets pledged = harder to leave
3. **AUM Preservation**: Clients don't sell to access cash
4. **Advisor Incentives**: Advisors paid based on loan balances
5. **Relationship Deepening**: Additional touchpoints with clients

### Client Benefits
- Access liquidity without triggering capital gains taxes
- Continue receiving dividends and appreciation
- Often lower rates than traditional loans
- No credit check required (portfolio is collateral)
- Quick access to funds

### Client Risks (FINRA Warnings)
- **Maintenance Calls**: If portfolio declines, must post collateral or repay
- **Forced Liquidation**: Firm can sell securities without notice
- **Tax Consequences**: Forced sales may trigger capital gains
- **Interest Rate Risk**: Variable rates can spike
- **Mobility Restrictions**: Difficult to move assets to new firm

### Competitive Positioning

| Firm | SBLOC Strength | Notable Features |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| **JPM** | ★★★★★ | Most competitive rates, 50-60% lending value, global capabilities |
| **Goldman** | ★★★★☆ | Strong for UHNW, integrated with alternatives strategy |
| **Morgan Stanley** | ★★★★☆ | Good rates through E*TRADE/Morgan Stanley Private Bank |
| **Schwab** | ★★★★☆ | Pledged Asset Line, competitive for $100K+ |
| **Fidelity** | ★★★★☆ | SBLOC through third-party partners |

### Lending as Retention Tool

From Reddit (client perspective): "JPM is very competitive - there is a reason why they give you discounts on lending."

Lending creates:
- Sticky relationships (can't easily move pledged assets)
- Additional revenue streams
- Deeper client engagement
- Cross-selling opportunities
