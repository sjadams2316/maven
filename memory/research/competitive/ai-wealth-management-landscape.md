## What's Struggling

### 1. **Standalone Independent Robos**
- Ellevest sold to Betterment
- Many smaller players absorbed or shuttered
- Nutmeg (UK) still unprofitable despite $1.5B AUM
- Low fees + small average accounts = unprofitable

### 2. **Niche Positioning**
- Ellevest's women-focused approach couldn't sustain scale
- Specialty doesn't overcome unit economics

### 3. **Price Competition**
- Schwab's free offering pressures everyone
- Race to bottom on fees
- Need scale or diversification to survive

### 4. **Regulatory Compliance**
- 44%+ of players struggle with evolving regulations
- Compliance is significant cost burden
- SEC scrutiny increasing

### 5. **Trust Issues**
- 91% of investors uncomfortable with machine-only decisions (ING survey)
- Algorithm limitations during market volatility
- Cybersecurity concerns

---

## Critical Gaps These Don't Address

### 1. **Holistic Financial Planning**
- Most robos optimize *portfolios*, not *financial lives*
- Limited consideration of:
  - Career income trajectory
  - Real estate holdings
  - Business ownership
  - Stock options/RSUs
  - Inheritance expectations
  - Health care costs
  - Insurance needs

### 2. **Retirement Drawdown**
- Only Vanguard and Schwab offer meaningful withdrawal guidance
- Most robos focus on accumulation, not decumulation
- Social Security optimization missing
- Medicare planning absent

### 3. **Complex Tax Situations**
- Stock option exercise timing
- Roth conversion strategies
- Capital gains harvesting (not just losses)
- Estate/gift tax planning
- Charitable giving optimization

### 4. **Life Transitions**
- Divorce financial planning
- Inheritance management
- Business sale proceeds
- Early retirement scenarios
- Disability planning

### 5. **Account Aggregation & Advice**
- Most can aggregate accounts but don't *advise* on external holdings
- Spouse/household-level optimization missing
- 401(k) held elsewhere not optimized

### 6. **Behavioral Coaching**
- Algorithms can't provide emotional support during volatility
- No proactive outreach during life events
- Limited personalization beyond risk questionnaire

### 7. **Alternative Investments**
- Most limited to public equities and bonds
- Private equity/credit access missing
- Real estate investment integration weak
- Cryptocurrency still limited (some offering via crypto ETFs)

### 8. **Estate Planning Integration**
- Trust management not supported
- Beneficiary optimization absent
- Multi-generational planning missing

### 9. **Personalized Communication**
- Questionnaire-based personalization is shallow
- No ongoing learning from user behavior
- Advice doesn't adapt to changing circumstances
- No proactive "you should consider..." suggestions

### 10. **Human-Level Judgment**
- Per Morningstar: "Robo advisors don't replace human judgment for estate planning or complex taxes"
- Can't reason from incomplete information
- No ability to handle hypotheticals or nuanced trade-offs
- "Severe contextual limitations" - can only do what explicitly programmed

---

## Future Outlook
