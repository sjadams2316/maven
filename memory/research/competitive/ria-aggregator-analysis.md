## 1. Creative Planning: The $300B+ Organic-to-Acquisition Powerhouse

### The Journey to Scale

Creative Planning represents one of the most remarkable growth stories in the RIA industry. Founded in 1983 in Overland Park, Kansas, the firm was acquired in 2004 by Peter Mallouk—an estate planning attorney who bought it when it managed just $34 million in assets with approximately 30 clients.

**Growth Trajectory:**
| Year | AUM | Key Milestones |
|------|-----|----------------|
| 2004 | $34M | Mallouk acquires firm |
| 2007 | $591M | Barron's recognition begins |
| 2011 | $2B | ~1,200 clients, purely organic |
| 2014 | $10B | Still no acquisitions |
| 2019 | $42B | First acquisition (Johnston Group, $500M) |
| 2020 | $69.5B | General Atlantic minority investment |
| 2023 | $130.5B | Goldman Sachs PFM acquisition |
| 2024 | $300B+ | TPG minority stake, $16B valuation |
| 2025 | $370B | Continued expansion |

### The Mallouk Methodology

**Phase 1: Organic Growth Foundation (2004-2019)**
- Built comprehensive wealth management model combining investment management, financial planning, tax, estate planning, and charitable giving
- Leveraged Schwab custodial referral programs
- Achieved recognition as #1 Independent Wealth Management Firm by Barron's (2017)
- Kansas City Business Journal noted: "Growth occurred without making any acquisitions or having an affiliation with a trust company or bank"

**Phase 2: Strategic Acquisitions (2019-Present)**
- First acquisition: Johnston Group ($500M AUM, Minneapolis, February 2019)
- Rapid expansion: 11 acquisitions totaling $7.2B in assets by November 2020
- Signature deal: Goldman Sachs Personal Financial Management ($29B AUM, August 2023)
- National TV advertising campaign launched alongside M&A strategy

**Private Equity Partnerships:**
- **February 2020:** General Atlantic acquires minority stake; Mallouk retains >80% equity
- **September 2024:** TPG Capital acquires minority stake; deal values firm at **$16 billion**
- Mallouk maintains majority ownership, has not diluted stake

### What Makes Creative Planning Different

According to David DeVoe: "Peter's a man of action—years ago he said he was going to acquire and did so faster than anyone in the business. And he's actively involved. Creative Planning is trending further upstream when it makes deals. Most consolidators or large buyers are landing firms with $750 million in assets. Peter's getting firms with $1.1 billion."

**Competitive positioning vs. Focus Financial:**
- Focus Financial controls ~$400B in RIA assets (as of 2025)
- Creative Planning approaching similar scale with far less partner complexity
- Creative Planning operates as unified firm; Focus operates via partner network

## 2. Focus Financial Partners: The Pioneer Roll-Up Model

### Historical Context

Founded in 2004 by Rudy Adolf (former McKinsey partner), Rajini Kodialam, and Lenny Chang, Focus Financial pioneered the RIA aggregator model.

**Key Milestones:**
- **2007:** 14 partner firms
- **2012:** $220M credit facility—"unique in the RIA industry"
- **2015:** First Canadian partner (Dorchester Wealth Management)
- **2017:** Australia expansion; Stone Point Capital & KKR acquire majority stake ($2B valuation)
- **2018:** IPO on Nasdaq—first RIA to go public
- **July 2018:** IPO raises $615.4M; stock jumps 14% first day
- **August 2023:** Clayton, Dubilier & Rice takes Focus private for **$7+ billion**

### The Original Partner Model

Adolf's founding vision: "We saw tens of thousands of independent firms out there, without good succession planning and handicapped by their small size. They were doing well, but could do better if they had some of the benefits of a big organization behind them without compromising their entrepreneurial independence and spirit."

**Structure:**
- Acquired firms retained entrepreneurial independence
- RIA retains operating autonomy through management company
- Focus acquires firms but has a split on cash flows through non-control agreement
- Philosophy: "Never turn a successful entrepreneur into an employee"

### The New Hub Strategy (Post-CD&R)

Since going private, Focus has undergone a dramatic transformation:

**From ~90 loosely affiliated firms → Five integrated "hub" firms:**

1. **Focus Partners Wealth** (Colony Group + Buckingham Strategic Wealth)
   - $50.2B+ combined AUM
   - 20,000+ clients, 90+ offices
   - Led by Michael Nathanson (Colony CEO) as Focus President

2. **Kovitz, a Focus Partners Firm**
   - Absorbed Telemus Capital, Relative Value Partners, Fort Pitt Capital
   - ~$30B in assets after consolidations

3. **SCS Financial, Focus Partners Family Office and OCIO**
   - Family office and OCIO capabilities

4. **Gelfand, Rennert & Feldman, Focus Partners Business Management**
   - First business management hub

5. **Cardinal Point, Focus Partners Canada**
   - Cross-border planning hub (named January 2025)

**The Challenge:**
- Michael Nathanson: "We're not forcing advisors to do anything they don't want to do"
- Consultant Jamie McLaughlin: "The only way to create the expected financial leverage of a roll up is integrating as many shared services across the independent firms as possible"
- One Focus partner CEO: "We know they want to own every one of us"

**The Incentive to Join Hubs:**
- Greater growth, scale, access to more capabilities
- Most transactions: exchange of sellers' equity for Focus equity
- Nathanson: "It's not about cashing out. It's about believing in the Focus business model and that equity in Focus will grow faster."

## 4. CI Financial / Corient: The Canadian Cross-Border Play

### The MacAlpine Strategy

## 5. What Aggregators Do to Acquired RIAs

### The Integration Spectrum

RIA aggregators operate across a wide spectrum of integration approaches:

**Minimal Integration (Autonomy-Focused):**
- Retain brand name
- Keep existing tech stack
- Maintain investment philosophy
- Share only back-office/compliance services
- Example: Early Focus Financial model

**Moderate Integration (Hub Model):**
- Co-branding or eventual brand alignment
- Standardized technology platforms
- Shared investment research
- Consolidated compliance
- Example: Current Focus "hub" strategy

**Full Integration:**
- Complete brand absorption
- Single ADV filing
- Unified tech stack
- Standardized client experience
- Example: Creative Planning approach

### Common Post-Acquisition Changes

**Operations:**
- Technology migration (CRM, portfolio management, reporting)
- Compliance standardization
- Consolidated vendor relationships
- Back-office centralization

**Investment:**
- Transition to standard investment models
- Access to broader product shelf (alternatives, private funds)
- Potential loss of proprietary investment philosophy

**Personnel:**
- Retention requirements (typically 3-5 years)
- Non-compete/non-solicit clauses
- Potential redundancies in compliance, operations, office management
- Career path opportunities in larger organization

### The Integration Challenge

Dan Garrett, Oyster Consulting: "We see firms that have just gone through an acquisition tear. They've bought 24 firms in two years, and they're all different, all on different systems, all with different cultures, and they wake up on a day going 'what have we done?' And it's almost too late to try and figure out how to bring it all together."

**Best Practices for Acquirers:**
1. Define vision, mission, and goals upfront
2. Build culture and platform BEFORE acquisitions
3. Set 3-5 key metrics beyond AUM
4. Tell joining advisors to be open to changes "for the greater good"
5. Strategic post-acquisition roadmap that evolves with each deal

**Advisor Experience:**
- Legacy portfolios may need to transition to standard models
- This "forces advisors to explain a new investment philosophy to their clients, potentially eroding hard-earned trust"
- Enterprise RIAs face dilemma: drive efficiency/scale vs. maintain customization

## 6. Valuation Multiples Being Paid

### Current Market Overview (2024-2025)

Based on industry data from DeVoe & Company, ECHELON Partners, Mercer Capital, and Park Sutton Advisors:

**Average EBITDA Multiples:**

| Firm Size (AUM) | EBITDA Multiple Range | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Under $500M | 8x - 11x | Rising in recent years |
| $500M - $3B | 10x - 15x | Sweet spot for acquirers |
| $3B - $20B | High teens (15x-19x) | Premium for scale |
| Over $20B | Low 20s+ | Trophy assets |
| Fisher Investments | 20x+ | $12.75B valuation; considered outlier |

**2024 Benchmarks (Advisor Growth Strategies):**
- Average EBITDA multiple for advisory 'businesses': **9.20x**
- Average topline recurring revenue multiple for 'books of business': Climbing
- Median deal multiple: **11x** adjusted EBITDA (BlackRock data)

**Premium Valuations:**
- PE-backed "meta" RIAs paying highest valuations
- Steven Levitt, Park Sutton: "A lot of our sellers are receiving very attractive deal terms now in the **15 to 20 times EBITDA multiple range**"
- ECHELON: Implied TTM EBITDA multiples exceeding **21x** for largest platforms

### What Drives Premium Multiples

**Positive Factors:**
1. **Organic growth rate:** 5-10% annual AUM inflows commands measurable premium
2. **Net new asset flows:** 1-2% or negative flows can result in outright rejection
3. **Diversified revenue streams:** Reduces concentration risk
4. **UHNW client base:** Higher margins, stickier relationships
5. **Modern technology infrastructure:** Reduces integration costs
6. **Recurring revenue:** 80%+ fee-based revenue preferred
7. **Advisor productivity:** >$1M revenue per head
8. **Strong succession planning:** Mitigates client retention risk

**Negative Factors:**
- Asset outflows
- Client/revenue concentration
- Aging advisor base without succession plan
- Outdated technology
- Compliance issues

### Deal Structure Trends

**Typical Terms (2024-2025):**
- **Upfront payment:** 60-70% of consideration
- **Retention payments:** 10-20%
- **Earnout/Growth incentives:** Remainder
- **Equity component:** Most deals include stock/equity swap

Brandon Kawal, Advisor Growth Strategies: "Upfront payments are still robust (60% plus of deal consideration), but buyers are not willing to give you a 'no risk' transaction."

**Emerging Considerations:**
- Length and hurdle levels for growth incentives
- Whether incentives include market upside/downside
- Equity appreciation potential vs. cash certainty
- Bid variance: Top offers can exceed lowest by **30%**

## 7. Aggregation: Threat or Exit Opportunity?

### The Case for Aggregation as Opportunity

**For Sellers:**
1. **Liquidity:** Access to capital at premium valuations
2. **Succession solution:** Structured path for ownership transition
3. **Growth acceleration:** Capital, resources, acquisition support
4. **Reduced burden:** Compliance, technology, HR, marketing offloaded
5. **Market timing:** Valuations at historic highs
6. **Risk reduction:** Diversification of personal wealth

**For the Industry:**
- Professional management and governance
- Investment in technology and compliance
- Career paths for next-generation advisors
- Capital for continued M&A
- Potential for "forever firms" with enduring value

### The Case for Aggregation as Threat

**Competitive Pressure:**
- Scale advantages in technology, compliance, marketing
- Recruiting leverage for top talent
- Brand recognition and national footprint
- Pricing power with vendors
- Better access to capital

**Client Impact Concerns:**
- Loss of personalized service
- Advisor turnover during transitions
- Investment philosophy changes
- Potential fee increases
- Relationship continuity risks

**Industry Concerns:**
- Concentration reducing competition
- PE influence on advisory relationships
- Exit pressure and short-term thinking
- Cultural homogenization

### The "Forever Firm" Thesis

The most successful approach combines:
- Cultural diligence in deal selection
- Tailored deal structures
- Multi-year integration roadmaps
- Growth AND retention focus
- Advisor lift (not just liquidity)

"RIAs that can execute on both growth and retention, while offering advisors real lift not just liquidity, will emerge as the industry's 'forever firms.'" — InvestmentNews analysis

### Strategic Options for Independent RIAs

**Option 1: Sell to Aggregator**
- Immediate liquidity (60-70% upfront)
- Ongoing earnouts tied to performance
- Support services and growth capital
- Succession solved
- Trade: Autonomy, potential upside cap

**Option 2: Minority PE Investment**
- Partial liquidity while retaining control
- Growth capital without full exit
- Board oversight/governance
- Future optionality
- Trade: Some governance control, eventual exit pressure

**Option 3: Stay Independent**
- Full autonomy and upside
- No integration disruption
- Cultural preservation
- Succession challenge remains
- Trade: Scale disadvantages, capital constraints

**Option 4: Merge with Peers**
- Achieve scale without outside capital
- Cultural alignment potential
- Shared governance
- Combined resources
- Trade: Complexity, alignment challenges

## 10. Strategic Implications

### For RIA Owners Considering Sale

1. **Timing:** Valuations remain at historic highs; window may not last forever
2. **Preparation:** 2-3 years of strong organic growth dramatically improves multiple
3. **Options:** Explore full sale, minority stake, merger—don't limit to one path
