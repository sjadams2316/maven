## 1. What is IRMAA?

**Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA)** is a surcharge added to Medicare Part B and Part D premiums for higher-income beneficiaries. It was established by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and began affecting Part B premiums in 2007 and Part D premiums in 2011.

### Key Points:
- **NOT a tax** — it's an additional premium amount
- Affects approximately **8% of Medicare beneficiaries**
- Applies to **both** Medicare Part B and Part D
- Paid **monthly** (deducted from Social Security or paid directly)
- Determined by **Social Security Administration (SSA)** based on IRS data
- Uses a **two-year lookback** to prior tax returns

### The Surprise Factor:
High earners often don't anticipate IRMAA because:
1. They weren't paying attention to Medicare costs pre-65
2. The two-year lookback means income from years ago affects current premiums
3. One-time income events (Roth conversions, stock sales) can push them into higher brackets
4. The "cliff" effect — going $1 over a threshold costs the full surcharge for the bracket

## 2. Income Thresholds and Surcharge Amounts

### 2025 IRMAA Brackets (Official CMS Data)

**Part B Monthly Premiums:**

| Single Filer MAGI | Married Filing Jointly MAGI | IRMAA | Total Monthly Premium |
|---|---|---|---|
| ≤ $106,000 | ≤ $212,000 | $0.00 | **$185.00** |
| $106,001 – $133,000 | $212,001 – $266,000 | $74.00 | **$259.00** |
| $133,001 – $167,000 | $266,001 – $334,000 | $185.00 | **$370.00** |
| $167,001 – $200,000 | $334,001 – $400,000 | $295.90 | **$480.90** |
| $200,001 – $499,999 | $400,001 – $749,999 | $406.90 | **$591.90** |
| ≥ $500,000 | ≥ $750,000 | $443.90 | **$628.90** |

**Part D Monthly IRMAA (added to plan premium):**

| Single Filer MAGI | Married Filing Jointly MAGI | Monthly IRMAA |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ $106,000 | ≤ $212,000 | $0.00 |
| $106,001 – $133,000 | $212,001 – $266,000 | $13.70 |
| $133,001 – $167,000 | $266,001 – $334,000 | $35.30 |
| $167,001 – $200,000 | $334,001 – $400,000 | $57.00 |
| $200,001 – $499,999 | $400,001 – $749,999 | $78.60 |
| ≥ $500,000 | ≥ $750,000 | $85.80 |

### 2024 IRMAA Brackets (for reference)

**Part B Monthly Premiums:**

| Single Filer MAGI | Married Filing Jointly MAGI | Total Monthly Premium |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ $103,000 | ≤ $206,000 | **$174.70** |
| $103,001 – $129,000 | $206,001 – $258,000 | **$244.60** |
| $129,001 – $161,000 | $258,001 – $322,000 | **$349.40** |
| $161,001 – $193,000 | $322,001 – $386,000 | **$454.20** |
| $193,001 – $499,999 | $386,001 – $749,999 | **$559.00** |
| ≥ $500,000 | ≥ $750,000 | **$594.00** |

### Married Filing Separately (Special Rules)

If married and lived together at any time during the year but file separately:

| 2025 Single MAGI (MFS) | Part B Total | Part D IRMAA |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ $106,000 | $185.00 | $0.00 |
| $106,001 – $393,999 | $591.90 | $78.60 |
| ≥ $394,000 | $628.90 | $85.80 |

⚠️ **MFS filing status creates a penalty** — there's no middle ground. You jump directly to the highest tiers.

### Annual Cost Impact (2025)

For a **married couple** both on Medicare:

| Bracket | Annual Part B Extra Cost | Annual Part D Extra Cost | **Total Annual IRMAA** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 (base) | $0 | $0 | **$0** |
| Tier 2 | $1,776 | $328.80 | **$2,104.80** |
| Tier 3 | $4,440 | $847.20 | **$5,287.20** |
| Tier 4 | $7,101.60 | $1,368 | **$8,469.60** |
| Tier 5 | $9,765.60 | $1,886.40 | **$11,652** |
| Tier 6 | $10,653.60 | $2,059.20 | **$12,712.80** |

---

## 3. The Two-Year Lookback Period

### How It Works

IRMAA for any given year is based on your **Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)** from **two years prior**:

| Medicare Year | Tax Year Used |
|---|---|
| 2025 | 2023 tax return |
| 2026 | 2024 tax return |
| 2027 | 2025 tax return |

### Why Two Years?
- SSA needs finalized IRS data
- Tax returns aren't filed until April (or later with extensions)
- IRS data exchange with SSA takes time

### Implications for Planning
- **Retirement timing matters**: Income in your last working year affects Medicare premiums two years later
- **Roth conversions**: Large conversions in years 63-65 impact premiums at 65-67
- **Stock sales/bonuses**: One-time income spikes have two-year delayed impact
- **Planning window**: You need to look ahead 2+ years when making income decisions

## 4. MAGI Calculation for IRMAA

### IRMAA MAGI = AGI + Tax-Exempt Interest

The MAGI used for IRMAA is simpler than other MAGI calculations:

**MAGI = Adjusted Gross Income (Line 11 of Form 1040) + Tax-Exempt Interest (Line 2a of Form 1040)**

### What's INCLUDED in IRMAA MAGI:

| Income Type | Included? |
|---|---|
| Wages and salaries | ✅ Yes |
| Self-employment income | ✅ Yes |
| Taxable IRA/401(k) distributions | ✅ Yes |
| Pension income | ✅ Yes |
| Capital gains (including LTCG) | ✅ Yes |
| Taxable Social Security benefits | ✅ Yes |
| Rental income | ✅ Yes |
| Business income (Schedule C, K-1) | ✅ Yes |
| **Tax-exempt municipal bond interest** | ✅ Yes (this surprises people!) |
| Dividends | ✅ Yes |
| Interest income | ✅ Yes |

### What's NOT Included:

| Income Type | Included? |
|---|---|
| Roth IRA distributions (qualified) | ❌ No |
| Return of basis from non-qualified accounts | ❌ No |
| Loans (HELOC, 401k loans, etc.) | ❌ No |
| Life insurance cash value withdrawals (up to basis) | ❌ No |
| HSA distributions for qualified expenses | ❌ No |

### Key Insight:
**Roth distributions don't count toward IRMAA MAGI** — this is why Roth conversions before Medicare are so valuable, despite the tension (see Section 7).

## 5. Life-Changing Events That Allow Appeals

If you experience certain life-changing events, you can request that SSA use more recent income data instead of the two-year lookback. This is done via **Form SSA-44**.

### Qualifying Life-Changing Events:

1. **Marriage**
2. **Divorce or annulment**
3. **Death of a spouse**
4. **Work stoppage** (retirement, layoff, reduced hours)
5. **Work reduction** (significant decrease in income)
6. **Loss of income-producing property** (disaster, foreclosure, etc.)
7. **Loss of pension income** (pension termination)
8. **Employer settlement payment** (severance due to employer's closure/bankruptcy)

### Appeal Process:

1. **Complete Form SSA-44** (Medicare Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount – Life-Changing Event)
2. Provide documentation proving the life-changing event
3. Provide estimate of current/future income
4. Submit to local Social Security office

### Documentation Required:
- Death certificate (spouse's death)
- Signed statement from employer (work stoppage)
- Letter from pension administrator (pension loss)
- Court documentation (divorce)
- Marriage certificate (marriage)

### What Does NOT Qualify:
- 🚫 Large one-time capital gain or stock sale
- 🚫 Roth conversion (even if it pushed you over)
- 🚫 Selling a business
- 🚫 "I didn't know about IRMAA"

### Timing:
- Appeals can be filed **any time** during the year
- Approved appeals apply to the **current calendar year**
- May need to re-file annually if circumstances continue

## 6. Strategies to Stay Below Thresholds

### The "Cliff" Problem

IRMAA brackets are **hard cliffs**, not gradual increases:
- Going $1 over the $212,000 threshold (MFJ) costs ~$2,105/year extra
- The marginal "tax rate" on that $1 is effectively **infinite**

### Strategy 1: Income Timing/Bunching

**Bunch deductions in alternating years:**
- Take larger charitable deductions in one year to offset income
- Use Donor Advised Fund for "lumpy" charitable giving
- Time itemized vs. standard deduction strategically

### Strategy 2: Tax-Loss Harvesting Near Thresholds

**Realize losses strategically:**
- Offset gains that would push you over IRMAA thresholds
- More valuable than just reducing taxable income

### Strategy 3: Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)

After age 70½:
- Donate directly from IRA to charity (up to $105,000 in 2025)
- QCD satisfies RMD but **does NOT appear in AGI**
- Perfect for those on the IRMAA edge

### Strategy 4: Roth Conversions BEFORE Age 63

**Front-load Roth conversions:**
- Convert heavily in years that won't affect Medicare
- Years 55-62 are the "conversion window" for many retirees
- Balance against other tax considerations

### Strategy 5: Asset Location for Income Control

**Place income-producing assets strategically:**
- High-yield bonds → Traditional IRA (distributions are controllable)
- Growth stocks → Taxable (control when gains realized)
- Municipal bonds → Reconsider if near IRMAA threshold (they count!)

### Strategy 6: Shift Income to Non-IRMAA Sources

**Draw from Roth accounts** when near thresholds:
- Roth IRA distributions don't count toward MAGI
- Mix traditional and Roth withdrawals to manage MAGI

### Strategy 7: Consider Medicare Part B Deferral

If still working at 65 with employer coverage:
- Can delay Part B enrollment
- May avoid IRMAA during high-income years
- Must enroll within 8 months of losing employer coverage

### Strategy 8: Business Owner Strategies

**For small business owners:**
- Adjust timing of K-1 income if possible
- Consider S-corp salary vs distribution mix
- Time business sales carefully

## 7. Roth Conversions and IRMAA Planning Tension

### The Paradox

Roth conversions are excellent for tax diversification, but they:
1. **Increase current-year MAGI** → potentially trigger IRMAA
2. Have a **two-year delayed impact** on Medicare premiums
3. Create tension between "convert now" and "avoid IRMAA"

### The Math

Example: $100,000 Roth conversion for someone at the threshold

**Costs:**
- Federal tax: $24,000 (24% bracket)
- State tax: ~$5,000 (varies)
- IRMAA for 2 years later: ~$2,105-$5,287 (depends on bracket jumped)
- **Total cost: ~$31,000-$34,000**

**Benefits:**
- Future tax-free growth
- No RMDs on Roth
- Tax-free income in retirement
- Estate planning benefits

### Optimal Strategy: The "Conversion Corridor"

**Ages 55-62**: Aggressive Roth conversions (no Medicare impact)
**Ages 63-64**: Moderate conversions (affects first Medicare years)
**Ages 65+**: Conservative conversions up to IRMAA thresholds

### When IRMAA Cost is Worth It

**Accept IRMAA when:**
- You expect to be in higher tax brackets later
- You have significant pre-tax assets ($1M+)
- You're in the 12%-22% bracket now (low conversion cost)
- You have decades of tax-free growth ahead
- Estate planning is a priority

**Avoid IRMAA when:**
- You're only slightly over the threshold
- The conversion would jump multiple IRMAA tiers
- You have limited time horizon
- You expect to be in lower brackets later

### The Numbers Game

**IRMAA Break-Even Analysis:**

If a $50,000 conversion triggers Tier 2 IRMAA (~$2,105/year for couple):
- One-time IRMAA cost: $2,105
- Required tax savings to break even: Need $2,105 / 0.12 = ~$17,500 less income taxed at 12% higher rate
- Time horizon matters: 20 years of tax-free growth often beats the one-time IRMAA hit

## 8. How Maven Should Warn Users About IRMAA Cliffs

### Warning Triggers

Maven should alert users when:

1. **Approaching age 63** — "Your income now will affect Medicare premiums in 2 years"
2. **MAGI within $20K of IRMAA threshold** — Show projected IRMAA cost
3. **Planning Roth conversion** — Include IRMAA impact in conversion analysis
4. **Large capital gains realized** — Flag potential IRMAA consequence
5. **Retirement year** — Special planning needed for income transition

### Warning Message Templates

**Approaching Threshold:**
```
⚠️ IRMAA Alert: Your projected 2024 MAGI is $205,000. If you exceed $212,000 
(joint), your 2026 Medicare premiums will increase by ~$2,105/year for you 
and your spouse.

Action: Consider deferring $7,000 of income or accelerating deductions.
```

**Roth Conversion Warning:**
```
⚠️ IRMAA Impact: This $50,000 Roth conversion will push your 2024 MAGI to 
$270,000, triggering Tier 3 IRMAA in 2026.

Cost: +$5,287/year in Medicare premiums (couple)
Recommendation: Consider limiting conversion to $42,000 to stay in Tier 2, 
saving $3,182/year in premiums.
```

**Age-Based Reminder:**
```
📋 Medicare Planning: You're turning 63 this year. Your 2025 income will 
determine your 2027 Medicare premiums (first full year of Medicare).

Your current projected MAGI: $350,000
Expected IRMAA: Tier 4 (+$8,470/year for couple)

Consider: Accelerating Roth conversions THIS year instead of next.
```
