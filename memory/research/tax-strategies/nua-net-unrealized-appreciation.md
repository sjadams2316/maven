# Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) Strategy

## Executive Summary for Maven

**NUA is a powerful, underutilized tax strategy that allows employees with highly appreciated company stock in their 401(k) to convert what would be ordinary income taxation (up to 37%) into long-term capital gains taxation (max 20%).** This represents a potential 17+ percentage point tax savings on significant wealth.

This is a **Maven differentiator opportunity** because:
- Most wealth platforms don't actively identify NUA-eligible portfolios
- The rules are complex enough that few investors know to ask
- The window for execution is narrow (must be done within a single tax year)
- Requires coordination between 401(k), IRA, and taxable accounts

---

## 1. What Is NUA and When Does It Apply?

### Definition
Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) is the difference between:
- **Cost basis**: The original price when employer stock was acquired in the retirement plan
- **Current market value**: What the stock is worth at the time of distribution

### Example
| | Amount |
|---|---|
| Original purchase: 5,000 shares @ $20 | $100,000 (cost basis) |
| Current value: 5,000 shares @ $100 | $500,000 |
| **Net Unrealized Appreciation** | **$400,000** |

### Key Insight
NUA is a **special IRS tax treatment** that allows the $400,000 gain to be taxed at long-term capital gains rates instead of ordinary income rates—even if the stock is sold immediately after distribution.

### When NUA Applies
NUA **only** applies to:
- **Employer stock** (not mutual funds, ETFs, or other investments)
- Stock held inside a **qualified employer retirement plan** (401(k), profit-sharing, pension, stock bonus plan, ESOP)
- Distributions that meet **triggering event** and **lump-sum** requirements

**Does NOT apply to:**
- Stock in a Roth IRA (already tax-free)
- Stock in a traditional IRA (loses NUA treatment if rolled over)
- Non-employer stock
- Stock in taxable brokerage accounts

## 2. The Tax Arbitrage: LTCG vs Ordinary Income

### The Core Math
| Tax Type | 2024 Top Rate | NUA Advantage |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Ordinary Income | 37% | — |
| Long-Term Capital Gains | 20% | **17% savings** |

*Plus: Ordinary income is subject to 3.8% NIIT in many cases, narrowing the spread slightly for high earners.*

### Example Tax Comparison

**Scenario:** $500,000 of employer stock with $100,000 cost basis

#### Without NUA (Standard Rollover to IRA)
When withdrawn from IRA in retirement:
- All $500,000 taxed as ordinary income
- At 37% bracket: **$185,000 in federal tax**

#### With NUA Strategy
At distribution:
- $100,000 cost basis taxed as ordinary income = $37,000 tax
- $400,000 NUA taxed at LTCG rates when sold = $80,000 tax
- **Total: $117,000 in federal tax**

**NUA Savings: $68,000** (37% reduction in tax burden)

### Important Nuance: Post-Distribution Gains
Any appreciation **after** the distribution (from NUA value to eventual sale price):
- Taxed based on holding period in taxable account
- <1 year: Short-term capital gains (ordinary income rates)
- >1 year: Long-term capital gains (favorable rates)

## 3. Lump-Sum Distribution Requirements

### The Critical Rule
To qualify for NUA treatment, you must take a **lump-sum distribution**:

**Definition:** The entire balance of ALL qualified plans of the same type must be distributed within a **single tax year**.

### What This Means Practically
- If you have multiple 401(k)s with the same employer, ALL must be distributed
- If you have a 401(k) AND a pension with the same employer, each type is treated separately
- The distribution doesn't have to happen in a single day—just within one calendar year

### The Split Strategy
You can divide the distribution into multiple streams:
1. **Employer stock → Taxable brokerage account** (preserves NUA treatment)
2. **Other assets → IRA rollover** (continues tax deferral)
3. **Cash distribution** (if needed)

**Critical:** The employer stock MUST go to a taxable account to preserve NUA. If rolled to an IRA, NUA treatment is permanently lost.

### Timing Considerations
- Plan carefully around calendar year end
- All distributions must complete within same tax year
- December distributions are risky (settlement delays could push into next year)

## 4. Triggering Events

### The Four Qualifying Events
NUA treatment is ONLY available after one of these triggering events:

| Event | Who Qualifies | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Separation from service** | Employees | Most common trigger. Includes termination, resignation, layoff, retirement |
| **Reaching age 59½** | Any participant | Can use while still employed |
| **Total and permanent disability** | Self-employed ONLY | Does not apply to regular employees |
| **Death** | Beneficiaries | Estate planning opportunity |

### Important Distinctions

**Separation from Service:**
- Must be complete separation (not reduced hours)
- Includes voluntary and involuntary termination
- Retirement qualifies

**Age 59½:**
- Unique advantage: Can execute NUA while still employed
- Provides planning flexibility
- Stock can remain in 401(k) past 59½; triggering event just "unlocks" eligibility

**Death:**
- Beneficiaries inherit NUA eligibility
- Potential estate planning angle (but step-up in basis may be better in many cases)

## 5. Cost Basis vs NUA Split

### Understanding the Split
When you take an NUA distribution:

| Component | Tax Treatment | When Taxed |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Cost Basis** | Ordinary income | Year of distribution |
| **NUA Amount** | Long-term capital gains | Year stock is sold |
| **Post-distribution appreciation** | Capital gains (ST or LT based on holding period) | Year stock is sold |

### Cost Basis Calculation
The cost basis for employer stock includes:
- Original purchase price
- Any after-tax contributions used to buy the stock
- The fair market value at the time of employer contributions (if gifted)

**Important:** Most 401(k) plans can provide the cost basis; some calculate NUA directly. Request this documentation BEFORE executing the strategy.

### Partial NUA Strategy
You don't have to take NUA on ALL employer stock:
- You can roll some shares to IRA (gives up NUA on those shares)
- You can take NUA on some shares to taxable account
- This allows calibrating taxable income in the distribution year

### Example of Calibrated Approach
| | Shares | Cost Basis | NUA |
|--|--------|------------|-----|
| To taxable (NUA) | 3,000 | $60,000 | $240,000 |
| To IRA (no NUA) | 2,000 | $40,000 | $160,000 |

This might be preferred to manage tax bracket impact in distribution year.

## 6. When NUA Beats Roth Conversion

### NUA vs Roth Conversion Decision Framework

Both strategies involve paying taxes now for future benefit. The right choice depends on multiple factors:

#### Choose NUA When:
| Factor | Why NUA Wins |
|--------|--------------|
| **High current appreciation** | The higher the NUA ratio (NUA/total value), the bigger the tax arbitrage |
| **Short holding period planned** | If you'll sell soon, get LTCG rates immediately |
| **High current tax bracket** | Paying ordinary income on cost basis only is favorable |
| **Near retirement** | Less time for Roth to compound tax-free |
| **Need liquidity** | NUA stock is accessible without penalty (though 10% penalty may apply to cost basis if under 59½) |

#### Choose Roth Conversion When:
| Factor | Why Roth Wins |
|--------|---------------|
| **Low current appreciation** | Less tax arbitrage to capture |
| **Very long time horizon** | Tax-free compounding for decades |
| **Lower current tax bracket** | Good time to "fill up" low brackets with conversions |
| **Plan to hold stock indefinitely** | Roth eliminates ALL future taxes |
| **Estate planning priority** | Roth has no RMDs, tax-free to heirs |

### Breakeven Analysis Framework
Rough rule of thumb: NUA typically wins if:
- NUA represents >50% of total stock value
- Time horizon is <15-20 years
- Current tax rate is relatively high

**For Maven:** A calculator comparing NUA vs Roth conversion based on:
- Cost basis vs current value
- Current vs expected future tax brackets
- Time horizon
- State tax considerations

...would be a highly valuable feature.

## 7. Step-by-Step Implementation

### Phase 1: Identification & Planning (3-6 months before)
1. **Identify eligibility**
   - Does user have employer stock in 401(k)?
   - What is the cost basis vs current value?
   - Has a triggering event occurred (or will soon)?

2. **Gather documentation**
   - Request cost basis information from plan administrator
   - Confirm NUA calculation methodology
   - Get current share count and values

3. **Run the numbers**
   - Calculate tax under NUA scenario
   - Calculate tax under standard rollover
   - Compare with Roth conversion option
   - Consider state tax implications

4. **Open accounts**
   - Set up taxable brokerage account to receive employer stock
   - Set up IRA (if not existing) to receive other assets

### Phase 2: Execution (Single Tax Year)
5. **Initiate distribution**
   - Contact plan administrator
   - Specify in-kind transfer of employer stock to taxable account
   - Specify IRA rollover for remaining assets
   - Request distribution paperwork clearly identifying NUA

6. **Document everything**
   - Form 1099-R will show:
     - Box 1: Total distribution value
     - Box 2a: Taxable amount (should be cost basis only)
     - Box 6: NUA amount
   - Keep all records

7. **Complete within calendar year**
   - Monitor transfer timeline
   - Ensure all transfers settle before December 31

### Phase 3: Post-Distribution Management
8. **Decide on stock**
   - Sell immediately: Realize LTCG on NUA
   - Hold for appreciation: Additional gains taxed based on holding period
   - Diversify gradually: Manage concentration risk

9. **Tax filing**
   - Report ordinary income on cost basis
   - Report capital gains when stock is sold
   - Ensure consistent cost basis reporting

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Rolling employer stock to IRA | Permanently loses NUA treatment |
| Missing lump-sum requirement | NUA treatment invalidated |
| Incomplete distribution before year-end | Must start over next year |
| Not requesting cost basis documentation | Can't accurately calculate benefit |
| Forgetting about early withdrawal penalty | 10% penalty applies to cost basis if under 59½ |

## 8. How Maven Should Identify NUA Opportunities

### Detection Criteria
Maven should flag NUA candidates when:

1. **Account type**: 401(k), profit-sharing, pension, ESOP
2. **Holding type**: Contains employer/company stock position
3. **Age/Status indicators**:
   - User age approaching 59½
   - Employment status changed (separation indicated)
   - Mentioned retirement planning
4. **Appreciation level**: Significant difference between cost basis and current value (if available)

### Data Requirements for Accurate Analysis
| Data Point | Source | Priority |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Employer stock position | Account aggregation | High |
| Cost basis | Plan administrator (may need user to request) | High |
| Current market value | Market data | High |
| User age | Profile | High |
| Employment status | Profile/user input | High |
| Other retirement accounts | Account aggregation | Medium |
| Current tax bracket | Tax planning module | Medium |
| State of residence | Profile | Medium |

### Suggested Maven Feature: NUA Opportunity Score
Calculate a score (0-100) based on:
- Size of employer stock position
- Estimated NUA ratio (if basis unknown, estimate based on tenure)
- Proximity to triggering event
- Tax bracket
- Time horizon

High scores trigger proactive outreach/education.

### User Journey
1. **Detection**: Maven identifies potential NUA opportunity
2. **Education**: Brief explanation of NUA strategy and potential savings
3. **Assessment**: Guided questions to gather missing data (cost basis, employment status)
4. **Analysis**: Comparative analysis: NUA vs Rollover vs Roth
5. **Planning**: If NUA favorable, timeline and checklist
6. **Execution support**: Reminders, document checklist, account setup guidance
7. **Post-distribution**: Portfolio rebalancing recommendations to address concentration

## Key Takeaways for Maven

### Why This Matters
1. **Material tax savings**: 10-20% of portfolio value in tax arbitrage
2. **Underutilized**: Most investors don't know about it; most platforms don't identify it
3. **Time-sensitive**: Triggering events create windows of opportunity
4. **Complex**: Requires coordination—perfect for an AI assistant

### Competitive Advantage
A wealth platform that proactively identifies NUA opportunities, educates users, and guides execution would deliver:
- **Quantifiable value** (tax savings are calculable and demonstrable)
- **Trust building** (sophisticated strategy = sophisticated platform)
- **Stickiness** (users engaged in multi-step planning stick around)
- **Differentiation** (most robo-advisors ignore this entirely)

### Implementation Priority
- **Phase 1**: Detection logic and educational content
- **Phase 2**: NUA calculator and comparison tool
- **Phase 3**: Guided execution workflow with checklist
- **Phase 4**: Integration with tax projection and estate planning modules
