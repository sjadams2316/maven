# QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) - Section 1202

## Executive Summary

**QSBS is one of the most powerful tax benefits in the Internal Revenue Code.** It allows non-corporate shareholders to exclude up to **100% of capital gains** (up to $15M or 10x basis) from federal income tax when selling qualified small business stock held for 5+ years.

**Potential tax savings:** ~$2.38M per $10M of gain at federal level (23.8% combined rate avoided)

**Maven opportunity:** Help users identify, track, and optimize QSBS eligibility—potentially saving them millions in taxes on startup exits.

## 1. What Qualifies as QSBS (Section 1202)?

### Shareholder Requirements (Must ALL be met)

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Eligible taxpayer** | Non-corporate only: individuals, partnerships (pass-through), S-corp shareholders, trusts, estates. **C corporations cannot claim the exclusion.** |
| **Original issuance** | Stock must be acquired directly from the company (not purchased from another shareholder). Exceptions: gifts, inheritance, partnership distributions |
| **Acquisition method** | Acquired for money, property (other than stock), or services |
| **Holding period** | See tiered structure below based on acquisition date |

### Corporation Requirements (Must ALL be met)

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Entity type** | Domestic (US) C corporation only. LLCs taxed as C-corps can qualify. |
| **Gross asset test** | Assets ≤ $75M at issuance and immediately after (post-July 4, 2025). Was $50M for pre-OBBBA stock. |
| **Active business test** | ≥80% of assets (by value) used in qualified trade or business during substantially all of holding period |

## 2. The 100% Exclusion Rules

### Acquisition Date & Holding Period Tiers

#### For QSBS Acquired AFTER July 4, 2025 (OBBBA Rules)

| Holding Period | Exclusion % | Effective Federal Rate | Max Exclusion |
|----------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------|
| 3 years | 50% | ~11.9% | $15M (or 10x basis) |
| 4 years | 75% | ~5.95% | $15M (or 10x basis) |
| **5+ years** | **100%** | **0%** | $15M (or 10x basis) |

#### For QSBS Acquired ON OR BEFORE July 4, 2025

| Period Acquired | Exclusion % | Holding Period | Max Exclusion |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| After 9/27/2010 | 100% | >5 years | $10M (or 10x basis) |
| 2/18/2009 - 9/27/2010 | 75% | >5 years | $10M (or 10x basis) |
| 8/11/1993 - 2/17/2009 | 50% | >5 years | $10M (or 10x basis) |

### What's Excluded from Tax?

When you qualify for 100% exclusion:
- ✅ Federal capital gains tax (up to 20%)
- ✅ Net Investment Income Tax (3.8%)
- ✅ Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

**Total federal tax savings at max rate: ~23.8% of gain**

## 3. The $10M/$15M or 10x Basis Limitation

### How the Cap Works

The gain exclusion is limited to the **GREATER of:**

| QSBS Acquired | Standard Cap | Alternative Cap |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| After July 4, 2025 | $15 million | 10x your adjusted basis in that issuer's stock |
| On/before July 4, 2025 | $10 million | 10x your adjusted basis in that issuer's stock |

### Cap Is Per Taxpayer, Per Issuer

**Critical:** The cap is calculated separately for each:
- **Taxpayer** (each person/trust is a separate taxpayer)
- **Issuer** (each company is tracked separately)

**Example:** If you invest in 3 different QSBS companies, you could potentially exclude up to $45M in gains ($15M each).

### The 10x Basis Rule

If you invest $2M in a company, your exclusion cap is the GREATER of:
- $15M (standard cap), OR
- $20M (10x your $2M basis)

**So with a $2M investment, you could exclude up to $20M in gain!**

### Married Filing Separately

For separate returns, the standard cap is halved:
- Post-OBBBA: $7.5M (instead of $15M)
- Pre-OBBBA: $5M (instead of $10M)

### Inflation Adjustment

Starting in 2027, the $15M cap and $75M asset test will be adjusted for inflation annually.

## 4. Stacking Strategies (Multiplying the Exclusion)

### Why Stacking Works

Because the cap is **per taxpayer, per issuer**, each separate taxpayer gets their own exclusion. This creates legitimate planning opportunities.

### Common Stacking Techniques

#### 1. **Gift QSBS to Family Members**

When you gift QSBS (before sale):
- The recipient inherits your holding period (tacking)
- The recipient gets their OWN exclusion cap
- Gift does not disqualify QSBS status

**Example:**
- Founder has $50M in QSBS gain
- Personal cap: $15M
- Gifts equal portions to spouse + 2 adult children before sale
- Each family member excludes $12.5M
- **Total exclusion: $50M** (vs. $15M without stacking)

⚠️ **Caution:** Gift tax implications apply. Annual exclusion is ~$18K/person; lifetime exemption ~$13M.

#### 2. **Non-Grantor Trusts**

Transfer QSBS to non-grantor trusts (treated as separate taxpayers):
- Each trust gets its own $15M cap
- Trust must be properly structured and have economic substance
- Consider trust situs in no-income-tax states (Nevada, South Dakota, Wyoming)

**Family trust strategy:**
- Create trusts for children/grandchildren
- Transfer QSBS before significant appreciation
- Each trust = separate taxpayer with own cap

#### 3. **Spousal Transfers**

- Gift/transfer to spouse
- Spouse has separate $15M cap
- Combined: up to $30M exclusion per company

#### 4. **Early Planning: Issue QSBS to Multiple Taxpayers**

- At company founding, issue shares directly to:
  - Each spouse individually
  - Family trusts
  - Each gets original issuance + own cap

### IRS Scrutiny Warning

The IRS and states increasingly scrutinize stacking strategies. Requirements:
- Trusts must have **economic substance**
- Must be legitimate transfers, not shams
- "In-name-only" out-of-state trusts face challenges
- Document business purpose beyond tax benefits

## 5. State Tax Treatment

### ⚠️ Critical: States Can Decouple from Federal QSBS

QSBS is a **federal** provision. States choose whether to conform.

### States That DO NOT Allow QSBS Exclusion

| State | Treatment | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **California** | Fully decoupled | Taxes QSBS gains as regular capital gains (up to 13.3%) |
| **Alabama** | Fully decoupled | Full state tax on QSBS gains |
| **Mississippi** | Fully decoupled | Full state tax on QSBS gains |
| **Pennsylvania** | Fully decoupled | Full state tax on QSBS gains |

**California is especially important** given its high concentration of tech founders/VCs. A "tax-free" federal exit can still cost 13.3% in CA state tax.

### States with Partial/Modified Conformity

| State | Treatment |
|-------|-----------|
| **Hawaii** | 50% exclusion only (even when federal is 100%) |
| **Massachusetts** | Has had limitations historically |
| **Wisconsin** | Has had partial conformity |
| **Washington** | No income tax BUT has capital gains excise tax with QSBS-style exclusion—complex planning required |

### States with Full Conformity (Follow Federal Rules)

36 states + DC conform to federal QSBS rules, including:
- New York (though high rates apply to any non-excluded portion)
- Texas, Florida, Nevada, Wyoming, South Dakota, Tennessee (no income tax = QSBS is fully tax-free)
- Most other states with income taxes

### New Jersey Update (2025)

New Jersey enacted legislation to adopt QSBS rules beginning with tax years starting on/after January 1, 2026.

### Strategic Implication

**Residency at time of sale matters, not company location.**

A California founder with a Delaware C-corp is taxed by California on QSBS gains. Incorporating in a "tax-friendly" state doesn't help if you live in a non-conforming state.

**Planning options:**
- Establish bona fide residency in no-tax state before sale
- Use non-grantor trusts domiciled in no-tax states
- ⚠️ California has clawback rules for "built-in gains" that accrued while resident

## 6. Common Mistakes & Gotchas

### 🚨 Critical Pitfalls to Avoid

#### 1. **Assuming All "Startups" Qualify**

Many venture-backed companies are in disqualified sectors:
- Fintech (often "financial services")
- Healthtech with clinical services
- Consulting-driven SaaS
- Service businesses disguised as "tech"

**Action:** Analyze actual revenue sources, not marketing positioning.

#### 2. **Stock Redemptions Can Blow QSBS Status**

Ill-timed buybacks can disqualify an **entire issuance**:
- Redemption rules apply to period: 1 year before to 2 years after issuance
- "Significant redemptions" (>5% of stock value) can taint QSBS status
- Exception: Redemptions incident to employee termination

**Action:** Review any secondary sales, buybacks, or recaps for QSBS impact.

#### 3. **Documentation Gaps**

5-10 years later, nobody can find clean records on:
- Date of original issuance
- Asset values at issuance (to prove $75M/$50M cap)
- How assets were used (to defend 80% active business test)
- Subscription documents, contribution agreements
- Section 83(b) elections for restricted stock

**Action:** Create and maintain a "QSBS File" from day one.

#### 4. **Losing Status Mid-Holding Period**

QSBS status must be maintained during "substantially all" of holding period:
- Company grows past $75M assets? No problem (tested at issuance only)
- Company shifts to >20% non-qualified activities? **QSBS status lost**
- Company converts to S-corp? **QSBS status lost**

#### 5. **Thinking LLC = Disqualified**

LLCs can issue QSBS **if they elect to be taxed as C-corporations** (check-the-box election).

#### 6. **Ignoring State Taxes**

California/Alabama/Mississippi/Pennsylvania founders are often shocked when they owe double-digit state tax on a "tax-free" exit.

#### 7. **Purchasing QSBS from Another Shareholder**

Stock bought from another shareholder (secondary market) **fails the original issuance requirement**—even if the company otherwise qualifies.

#### 8. **Restricted Stock Without 83(b) Election**

If stock is subject to vesting, the holding period doesn't start until vesting—**unless** the employee files a timely Section 83(b) election within 30 days of grant.

#### 9. **Rollover Equity to Partnership**

If QSBS is rolled into an LLC/LP in an M&A transaction, the stock loses QSBS status in the partnership's hands.

#### 10. **Put Options / Hedging**

Establishing "offsetting short positions" (put options at fixed price, short sales) can trigger loss of QSBS status.

## 7. How Maven Should Identify & Track QSBS Opportunities

### Data Points to Capture

For each user investment in a private company:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Entity type** | C-corp required (or LLC taxed as C-corp) |
| **Acquisition date** | Start of holding period; determines which rules apply |
| **Acquisition method** | Original issuance, gift, inheritance, conversion? |
| **Cost basis** | Needed for 10x cap calculation |
| **Company gross assets at issuance** | Must be ≤$75M (post-OBBBA) or ≤$50M (pre-OBBBA) |
| **Business type** | Qualified vs. excluded (see Section 1 above) |
| **83(b) election filed?** | For restricted stock grants |
| **State of residence** | Determines state tax treatment |

### Automated Alerts/Reminders

1. **Approaching 3/4/5-year holding period milestones**
   - "Your [Company] shares will reach 5-year QSBS status on [date]. 100% federal exclusion will apply."

2. **Potential exit events**
   - "Before selling [Company], ensure QSBS documentation is in order."

3. **Stacking opportunity**
   - "Your QSBS gain may exceed $15M. Consider gifting shares to family members before sale."

4. **State tax warning**
   - "You live in [California]. Despite federal QSBS exclusion, you may owe ~13.3% state capital gains tax."

5. **83(b) deadline**
   - "You received restricted stock. File 83(b) election within 30 days to start QSBS clock."

### QSBS Eligibility Scoring

Create a "QSBS Score" for each investment:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ✅ **Likely QSBS** | C-corp, qualified business, <$75M assets, original issuance, holding period met |
| ⚠️ **Possible QSBS** | Some criteria unclear; needs documentation review |
| ❌ **Not QSBS** | S-corp, LLC partnership, excluded business, secondary purchase |
| 🔄 **Pending** | Holding period not yet met |

### Documentation Checklist for Users

Prompt users to upload/confirm:
- [ ] Stock purchase agreement / subscription docs
- [ ] 83(b) election (if restricted stock)
- [ ] Company confirmation of C-corp status
- [ ] Company assets at issuance (balance sheet/cap table)
- [ ] Business description (to assess qualified trade/business)

### Pre-Exit Checklist

When user indicates potential sale:

1. ✅ Confirm holding period status
2. ✅ Calculate estimated exclusion ($15M or 10x basis)
3. ✅ Assess state tax exposure
4. ✅ Evaluate stacking opportunities (family gifts, trusts)
5. ✅ Check for redemption issues
6. ✅ Gather documentation for tax advisor
7. ✅ Consider Section 1045 rollover if early exit

### Section 1045 Rollover Option

If selling before 5-year mark:
- Section 1045 allows tax-free rollover into new QSBS
- Must reinvest within 60 days
- Holding periods tack (original + replacement)
- Useful when exit happens early but want to defer gain

## Key Takeaways for Maven

1. **QSBS can eliminate millions in taxes**—but only with proper planning and documentation
2. **Not all "startups" qualify**—service businesses, fintech, healthtech often excluded
3. **State taxes can still bite**—especially California (13.3% on gains)
4. **Stacking multiplies the benefit**—gifts to family, trusts each get separate caps
5. **Documentation is critical**—start the QSBS file at issuance, not at exit
6. **Timing matters**—holding period, 83(b) elections, redemption windows
7. **Maven can add massive value** by tracking these details automatically and alerting users to opportunities/risks
