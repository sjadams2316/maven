## Executive Summary

Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs) provide **capital gains tax incentives** for investments in designated economically distressed communities. Key benefits include **gain deferral until 2026**, **basis step-up for 5-7 year holding periods**, and **permanent exclusion of appreciation** after 10 years. With the deferral period ending December 31, 2026, understanding the current state and planning implications is critical.

## 1. QOZ Program Overview

### Legislative Background

- **Created**: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (December 22, 2017)
- **Purpose**: Spur economic development in distressed communities
- **Mechanism**: Tax incentives for capital gains reinvestment

### Three Core Tax Benefits

| Benefit | Requirement | Effect |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Deferral** | Invest capital gain in QOF | Defer tax until sale or Dec 31, 2026 |
| **Basis Step-Up (5 yr)** | Hold QOF investment 5+ years | 10% of deferred gain excluded |
| **Basis Step-Up (7 yr)** | Hold QOF investment 7+ years | 15% of deferred gain excluded |
| **Permanent Exclusion** | Hold QOF investment 10+ years | Eliminate tax on QOF appreciation |

### Current Status (2026)

**Key Date**: December 31, 2026 - Deferral period ends

- All deferred gains become taxable (or upon earlier sale)
- 10-year appreciation exclusion still available for QOF investments made before certain dates
- 5-year and 7-year step-up benefits have largely phased out for new investments

---

## 2. The 180-Day Investment Rule

### Timing Requirement

**You must invest capital gains in a QOF within 180 days** of realizing the gain.

### When Does the 180-Day Period Start?

| Gain Type | 180-Day Period Starts |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Stock/bond sale** | Date of sale |
| **Installment sale** | Date each installment received (or year-end option) |
| **Partnership K-1 gain** | Last day of partnership tax year, OR date partnership realized gain, OR due date of partnership return |
| **S-Corp K-1 gain** | Same options as partnership |
| **Section 1231 gain** | Last day of tax year (when gain netted) |
| **RIC/REIT capital gain dividend** | Last day of tax year OR date of distribution |

### Example: Partnership Flow-Through

```
Partnership sells asset July 1, 2024
Partnership tax year ends December 31, 2024
Partner receives K-1 in March 2025

Partner's options for 180-day start date:
1. July 1, 2024 (date of sale)
2. December 31, 2024 (partnership year-end)
3. March 15, 2025 (partnership return due date)

Most flexibility: Choose March 15, 2025 → Must invest by September 10, 2025
```

## 4. Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs)

### What Is a QOF?

A **Qualified Opportunity Fund** is an investment vehicle (corporation or partnership) that:
1. Is organized to invest in QOZ property
2. Self-certifies by filing **Form 8996** with its tax return
3. Holds at least **90% of assets** in QOZ property

### Forming or Investing in a QOF

**Options:**
1. **Start a QOF**: Form LLC/Corp, elect QOF status, invest in QOZ property
2. **Invest in existing QOF**: Real estate funds, business investment funds

### 90% Asset Test

QOF must hold 90%+ in **QOZ Property**:
- QOZ Stock
- QOZ Partnership Interest
- QOZ Business Property

**Testing dates**: June 30 and December 31 each year
**Penalty**: Monthly shortfall penalty if below 90%

### What Is QOZ Business Property?

Tangible property used in trade or business in a QOZ that:
1. Acquired by purchase after December 31, 2017
2. Original use begins with QOF, OR substantially improved
3. Used substantially all (70%+) in QOZ during substantially all (90%+) holding period

---

## 5. Substantial Improvement Requirement

### The Rule

If property is NOT original use, it must be **substantially improved**:

```
Substantial Improvement Test:
Additions to basis (during 30-month period) > Original cost basis
```

### Example

```
Purchase existing building for $1,000,000
Must spend >$1,000,000 on improvements within 30 months
Total investment: $2,000,000+ to qualify
```

### What Counts as Improvements?

- Building renovations
- Capital improvements
- NOT: land (land doesn't need substantial improvement)
- NOT: routine maintenance

---

## 6. Deferral Mechanics

### How Deferral Works

1. **Realize capital gain** from sale of property
2. **Invest gain amount** in QOF within 180 days
3. **Elect deferral** on Form 8949 with tax return
4. **Gain excluded from income** until inclusion event

### What Triggers Inclusion (End of Deferral)?

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Sale of QOF investment | Deferred gain recognized |
| December 31, 2026 | Remaining deferred gain recognized |
| Gift of QOF investment | Inclusion event (donee gets non-qualifying investment) |
| QOF liquidation | Inclusion event |
| Distribution exceeding basis | May trigger partial inclusion |

### Amount of Gain Recognized

```
Gain Recognized = Lesser of:
1. Original deferred gain (reduced by basis step-up), OR  
2. Fair market value of QOF investment on inclusion date
```

---

## 7. Basis Step-Up Benefits (Historical)

### Original Structure (Now Largely Unavailable)

| Holding Period | Basis Increase | Effect |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| 5 years | 10% of deferred gain | 10% exclusion |
| 7 years | Additional 5% (total 15%) | 15% exclusion |
| 10 years | FMV at sale | Appreciation excluded |

### Current Status (2025-2026)

**5-Year Step-Up**: Investment needed by December 31, 2021 (5 years before 12/31/2026)
**7-Year Step-Up**: Investment needed by December 31, 2019 (7 years before 12/31/2026)

**For new investments (2024-2026)**: Only the 10-year appreciation exclusion remains meaningful for long-term holders.

---

## 8. The 10-Year Appreciation Exclusion

### How It Works

After holding QOF investment for **10+ years**, you can elect to:
- Exclude ALL appreciation from the QOF investment
- Basis steps up to FMV at time of sale
- Only pay tax on original deferred gain (in 2026 or earlier)

### Example

```
2020: Realize $500,000 capital gain
2020: Invest $500,000 in QOF
2026: Pay tax on $425,000 (original gain minus 15% step-up)
2030: QOF investment worth $1,200,000
2030: Sell QOF investment

Tax Result:
- Already paid tax on deferred gain: $425,000 @ rate
- Appreciation: $1,200,000 - $500,000 = $700,000
- Tax on appreciation: $0 (10-year exclusion)
```

### Critical Planning Point

Even though deferral ends 12/31/2026, the **10-year exclusion for appreciation** still applies to investments held 10+ years. This remains a significant benefit.

## 9. Reporting Requirements

### Investor Reporting

**Form 8949**: Report deferral election
- Code "Z" in Column (f)
- Report gain on appropriate schedule
- Include "QOF" notation

**Form 8997**: Annual Statement of QOF Investments
- Due with tax return each year
- Track deferred gains and QOF investments
- Report any inclusion events

### QOF Reporting

**Form 8996**: Qualified Opportunity Fund
- Filed with QOF's tax return
- Certifies QOF status
- Reports 90% asset test compliance

---

## 10. Planning Considerations (2025-2026)

### Current Investment Decisions

**For new QOZ investments now:**
- No 5-year or 7-year step-up (deadlines passed)
- Still get deferral until 12/31/2026
- Still get 10-year appreciation exclusion

**Break-even analysis:**
```
Is QOZ investment worth it without basis step-up?

Factors to consider:
- Quality of underlying investment
- Expected appreciation
- Risk tolerance
- Investment horizon (need 10+ years for full benefit)
- Alternative investment options
```

### Pre-2026 Planning

**Investors with existing QOF investments:**
1. Verify 10-year hold eligibility
2. Plan for 2026 tax liability on deferred gain
3. Consider tax planning for inclusion year
4. Evaluate exit timing vs. 10-year exclusion

### Post-2026 Landscape

**After December 31, 2026:**
- Deferred gains become taxable
- QOZ program continues for new investments
- 10-year appreciation exclusion still available
- Watch for potential legislative extensions/modifications

## 11. Common QOZ Investment Types

### Real Estate (Most Common)

| Structure | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Direct ownership** | Form QOF, purchase/develop property in QOZ |
| **Syndicated funds** | Invest in pooled QOF owning multiple properties |
| **Ground-up development** | Original use property (no substantial improvement needed) |
| **Rehabilitation** | Buy existing; substantially improve |

### Operating Businesses

- Start new business in QOZ
- Expand existing business into QOZ
- Less common; more complex compliance
