## Executive Summary

Charitable giving optimization represents one of the most underutilized tax planning opportunities for wealth management clients. **Many users leave money on the table by donating cash instead of appreciated assets.** This document provides a comprehensive analysis of charitable giving strategies Maven should proactively identify and recommend.

### Key Insight
A donor who gives $50,000 worth of appreciated stock (cost basis $10,000) instead of cash can save an additional **$9,520 in taxes** while providing the same charitable impact.

## ⚠️ URGENT: 2026 Tax Law Changes (One Big Beautiful Bill Act)

The OBBBA introduces significant changes effective **January 1, 2026** that Maven must account for:

### New Rules for Itemizers
1. **0.5% Floor on Charitable Deductions**: Charitable donations below 0.5% of AGI will no longer be deductible
   - Example: $200,000 AGI → first $1,000 of donations not deductible
2. **35% Cap on Deduction Value**: High earners (37% bracket) now get only $0.35 per dollar donated vs $0.37 previously
3. **Permanent 60% AGI limit** for cash contributions, 50% for non-cash

### New Benefit for Non-Itemizers
- Permanent $1,000 deduction per filer ($2,000 MFJ) for cash donations to operating charities (not DAFs)
- ~86% of taxpayers now take standard deduction

### Maven Action Item
**Proactively recommend clients accelerate charitable giving into 2025** to avoid the new 0.5% floor and deduction value limitations.

## 1. Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs)

### What Is a DAF?
An investment account that provides:
- **Immediate tax deduction** when you contribute
- **Tax-free growth** of invested assets
- **Flexibility** to recommend grants to charities on your timeline
- **Simplicity** – sponsoring organization handles administration

### Major DAF Providers Comparison

| Provider | Min to Open | Min Grant | Admin Fee | Min Annual Fee |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Schwab Charitable** | $0 | $50 | 0.60% | None |
| **Fidelity Charitable** | $0 | $50 | 0.60% | $100 |
| **Vanguard Charitable** | $25,000 | $500 | 0.60% | $250 |
| **Daffy** | $0 | $18 | Flat fee | $36-$480/yr |
| **Charityvest** | $0 | $15 | 0.60% | None (cash only) |

### Fee Analysis
- **Under $6,000**: Schwab (no minimum fee)
- **$6,000-$40,000**: Daffy $3/month tier ($36/yr)
- **$40,000+**: Daffy $20/month tier ($240/yr) beats percentage-based fees
- **$1M+**: Negotiate directly with any major provider

### Best Practices
- Match DAF provider to existing brokerage relationship for simplicity
- Use DAF as the "giving bucket" – contribute appreciated assets, distribute strategically
- Name DAF as charitable beneficiary of retirement accounts (tax-free withdrawal)

### DAF vs Direct Donation
| Scenario | Donate Directly | Use DAF |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| Know charities now | ✓ Direct | Either |
| Want to bunch contributions | - | ✓ DAF |
| Donating appreciated stock | Either (if charity accepts) | ✓ DAF (universal acceptance) |
| Privacy desired | ❌ | ✓ DAF (anonymous grants) |
| Complex assets (real estate, crypto) | ❌ Usually not | ✓ DAF |

## 2. Donating Appreciated Stock vs. Cash

### The Double Tax Benefit
Donating long-term appreciated securities provides TWO tax advantages:
1. **Avoid capital gains tax** on the appreciation
2. **Receive full fair market value deduction**

### Tax Math Example

**Scenario**: $50,000 stock with $10,000 cost basis (held >1 year)
**Taxpayer**: 35% income tax bracket, 20% LTCG + 3.8% NIIT

| Method | Value to Charity | Tax Benefit |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Sell stock, donate cash | $50,000 - $9,520 (taxes) = $40,480 | $40,480 × 35% = $14,168 |
| Donate stock directly | $50,000 | $50,000 × 35% = $17,500 **+ $9,520 avoided gains** |
| **Additional benefit** | **$9,520 more to charity** | **$12,852 additional tax savings** |

### Step-Up Cost Basis Strategy
If donating appreciated stock, **use the cash you would have donated to buy new shares** of the same stock:
- Charitable impact: Same
- Tax benefit: Full appreciation deduction + avoided capital gains
- Portfolio: Now holds stock with stepped-up cost basis

### AGI Limits
- **Cash**: 60% of AGI (permanent under OBBBA)
- **Appreciated securities**: 30% of AGI
- **Excess**: Carry forward up to 5 years

### Maven Opportunity Signals
Flag accounts where:
- [ ] Appreciated positions >200% of cost basis exist
- [ ] User has charitable intent or history
- [ ] Year-end approaching
- [ ] High-income year (bonus, RSU vesting, business sale)

## 3. Bunching Strategies with Standard Deduction

### The Problem
- 2025 Standard deduction: $15,750 (single) / $31,500 (MFJ)
- ~86% of taxpayers take standard deduction
- Small annual donations = no tax benefit

### The Solution: Bunching
Concentrate multiple years of charitable giving into a single year to exceed standard deduction threshold.

### Example: Married Couple Filing Jointly

**Without Bunching (2024-2025)**
| Year | Charitable | Other Deductions | Total | vs Standard | Tax Benefit |
|------|------------|------------------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 2024 | $10,000 | $15,000 | $25,000 | Take $29,200 std | $0 extra |
| 2025 | $10,000 | $15,000 | $25,000 | Take $31,500 std | $0 extra |
| **Total** | $20,000 | - | - | $60,700 | - |

**With Bunching (all giving in 2024)**
| Year | Charitable | Other Deductions | Total | vs Standard | Tax Benefit |
|------|------------|------------------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 2024 | $20,000 | $15,000 | $35,000 | Itemize $35,000 | $5,800 extra |
| 2025 | $0 | $15,000 | $15,000 | Take $31,500 std | - |
| **Total** | $20,000 | - | - | $66,500 | **+$5,800** |

### Three-Year Bunching
Even more powerful – bunch 3 years of giving:
- $60,000 charitable + $25,000 other = $85,000 itemized
- Two years of standard deduction = $63,000
- **Total: $148,000** vs **$85,500** without bunching
- **Additional deductions: $53,500**
- **Tax savings at 35%: ~$18,725**

### DAF + Bunching = Perfect Combination
1. Contribute 3-5 years of charitable giving to DAF in one year
2. Take large itemized deduction that year
3. Take standard deduction in subsequent years
4. Recommend grants from DAF to charities on normal annual schedule

### Maven Implementation
- Calculate: Does user's annual giving + other deductions exceed standard deduction?
- If close but not over: Recommend bunching strategy
- Flag users who itemize marginally – bunching opportunity exists

## 4. Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) from IRAs

### What Is a QCD?
A direct transfer from an IRA to a qualified charity that:
- Counts toward Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)
- **Excludes the amount from taxable income**
- Does NOT require itemization

### 2025-2026 QCD Rules

| Rule | 2025 | 2026 |
|------|------|------|
| Annual limit per person | $108,000 | $111,000 |
| Age requirement | 70½+ | 70½+ |
| RMD age | 73+ | 73+ |
| Eligible accounts | IRA, Roth IRA, inactive SEP/SIMPLE | Same |
| Ineligible accounts | 401(k), employer plans | Same |
| One-time to CRT/CGA | $54,000 | TBD |

### Why QCDs Beat Itemized Deductions

**Scenario**: 72-year-old with $50,000 RMD, wants to give $20,000 to charity

| Method | Taxable Income | Deduction | Net Benefit |
|--------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Take RMD, donate cash | $50,000 | $20,000 (if itemizing) | Reduces income by $20,000 |
| QCD $20,000 | $30,000 | None (but doesn't need one) | **Income reduced by $20,000 PLUS lower AGI** |

### QCD Advantages Over Standard Donations
1. **Works even if taking standard deduction** – most retirees don't itemize
2. **Reduces AGI directly** – affects:
   - Medicare Part B/D premiums (IRMAA)
   - Social Security taxation
   - Net Investment Income Tax threshold
   - State tax deductions
3. **Satisfies RMD** without increasing taxable income

### Key Restrictions
- ❌ Cannot go to donor-advised funds
- ❌ Cannot go to private foundations
- ❌ Cannot receive anything in return (no gala tickets, etc.)
- ✓ Must be direct transfer (check payable to charity is OK if delivered by donor)

### Maven Opportunity Signals
- [ ] User age 70½+ with traditional IRA
- [ ] User has charitable giving history
- [ ] User is close to IRMAA threshold
- [ ] User doesn't itemize deductions
- [ ] User has RMD approaching

## 5. Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs)

### What Is a CRT?
An irrevocable trust that provides:
1. **Income stream** to donor (or beneficiaries) for life or term of years
2. **Remainder** goes to charity when trust terminates
3. **Immediate partial tax deduction** based on present value of charitable remainder

### Two Types

| Feature | CRAT (Annuity Trust) | CRUT (Unitrust) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Annual payout | Fixed dollar amount | Fixed % of trust value (revalued annually) |
| Additional contributions | ❌ Not allowed | ✓ Allowed |
| Inflation protection | ❌ | ✓ Payout grows if trust grows |
| Best for | Older donors wanting stability | Younger donors, fluctuating income OK |

### IRS Requirements
- **5% minimum** annual payout to non-charitable beneficiary
- **50% maximum** annual payout
- **10% minimum** present value must go to charity (actuarial calculation)
- Maximum term: 20 years (or life of beneficiaries)

### When CRTs Make Sense
✅ **Good candidates:**
- Highly appreciated, low-yield assets (e.g., concentrated stock, real estate)
- Need income but want charitable legacy
- Older donors (higher charitable deduction due to shorter life expectancy)
- Want to diversify without immediate capital gains hit

❌ **Poor candidates:**
- Young donors (may fail 10% remainder test)
- Need liquidity or access to principal
- Small assets (setup costs ~$1,500-$5,000 + ongoing admin)

### Tax Benefits
1. **Partial income tax deduction** at funding (calculated on remainder interest)
2. **No capital gains** when trust sells appreciated assets
3. **Estate tax reduction** – assets removed from taxable estate

### CRT + DAF Combination
Name a DAF as the charitable remainder beneficiary for:
- Greater flexibility to change ultimate charities
- Lower cost than amending trust
- Continued family involvement in grant decisions

### Maven Opportunity Signals
- [ ] User age 60+ with highly appreciated concentrated position
- [ ] User discussing retirement income needs
- [ ] User has estate planning concerns
- [ ] User mentioned wanting to leave charitable legacy
- [ ] Single stock position >$500,000 with low basis

## 6. Private Foundations vs. DAFs

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Donor-Advised Fund | Private Foundation |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Setup time** | Immediate | Weeks to months |
| **Setup cost** | $0 | $5,000-$15,000+ legal fees |
| **Ongoing admin** | 0.6-0.85% | 2.5-4% annually |
| **Tax deduction (cash)** | 60% of AGI | 30% of AGI |
| **Tax deduction (stock)** | 30% AGI, FMV | 20% AGI, FMV (publicly traded) |
| **Tax deduction (other)** | FMV | Cost basis |
| **Required payout** | None (recommended) | 5% of assets annually |
| **Excise tax** | None | 1.39% of net investment income |
| **Privacy** | Anonymous possible | Public 990-PF required |
| **Control** | Advisory only | Full control |
| **Legacy** | Successor advisors | Family board perpetuity |
| **Minimum practical size** | $5,000 | $1,000,000+ |

### When to Choose DAF
- Simplicity is priority
- Assets under $1M
- Privacy desired
- Maximum tax deduction needed
- No desire to manage administration

### When to Choose Private Foundation
- Assets over $5M+ committed to philanthropy
- Desire full control over investments and grants
- Want to hire family members or pay expenses
- Family legacy and governance important
- Willing to manage compliance burden

### Hybrid Strategy
Use BOTH:
- Foundation for family legacy, governance, employment
- DAF for:
  - Accepting hard-to-value assets
  - Anonymous grants
  - Satisfying 5% payout requirement easily

### Maven Opportunity Signals
- [ ] User has expressed interest in family philanthropy
- [ ] User has $1M+ in charitable assets
- [ ] User has existing private foundation struggling with admin
- [ ] User desires privacy but currently uses foundation

## 7. Cryptocurrency Donations

### IRS Treatment
Cryptocurrency is treated as **property** (like stock), not currency.

### Tax Benefits of Donating Crypto
- ✓ **Avoid capital gains tax** on appreciation
- ✓ **Deduct fair market value** (if held >1 year)
- ✓ No taxable event for the donor

### Holding Period Rules

| Holding Period | Deduction Amount |
|---------------|------------------|
| >1 year (long-term) | Fair market value |
| ≤1 year (short-term) | Lesser of cost basis OR FMV |

### Valuation Requirements
- Crypto worth **>$5,000** requires qualified appraisal
- Use reputable exchange price at time of donation
- Document date, time, and exchange used

### Donation Channels
1. **Direct to charity** (if they accept crypto) – Fidelity Charitable, Schwab Charitable accept crypto
2. **Through DAF** – Most major DAFs now accept crypto
3. **Specialty platforms** – The Giving Block, Coinbase Giving

### AGI Limits
- **Long-term crypto**: 30% of AGI (like other appreciated property)
- **Short-term crypto**: 50% of AGI (limited to cost basis)

### Special Considerations
- ⚠️ Volatility – time donation for tax year with high value
- ⚠️ Wash sale rules don't apply to crypto – can donate and immediately rebuy
- ⚠️ Form 8283 required for donations >$500

### Maven Opportunity Signals
- [ ] User holds significant crypto positions with gains
- [ ] User has charitable intent
- [ ] Crypto position has >100% gain
- [ ] Year-end tax planning conversations

## 8. Maven Proactive Opportunity Identification

### High-Value Trigger Events

Maven should monitor for these signals to proactively suggest charitable giving optimization:

#### Portfolio Signals
| Signal | Opportunity |
|--------|-------------|
| Position >200% of cost basis | Donate appreciated stock |
| Concentrated position >10% of portfolio | Use CRT or direct donation for diversification |
| Rebalancing needed | Part-gift, part-sale strategy |
| Year-end with unrealized gains | Harvest charitable gains |
| Crypto position with large gains | Donate crypto |

#### Life Event Signals
| Event | Opportunity |
|-------|-------------|
| Business sale / acquisition | Contribute pre-sale equity to CRT or DAF |
| IPO / liquidity event | Donate appreciated shares |
| Retirement approaching | QCD planning, CRT for income |
| Age 70½ reached | QCD becomes available |
| Age 73 reached | RMD + QCD coordination |
| High-income year (bonus, RSU vesting) | Bunching strategy |
| Estate planning conversations | CRT, foundation, DAF legacy planning |
| Year client doesn't itemize | QCD, bunching for next year |

#### Calendar Signals
| Timing | Action |
|--------|--------|
| November-December | Year-end giving optimization |
| Q4 | Bunching decisions before Dec 31 |
| Before RMD deadline | QCD coordination |
| **2025 specifically** | Accelerate giving before OBBBA 0.5% floor |

### Proactive Conversation Starters

**For users with appreciated stock:**
> "I noticed your [STOCK] position has appreciated significantly. If you're planning any charitable giving this year, donating the shares directly could save you an additional $X in taxes compared to donating cash."

**For users 70½+ with IRAs:**
> "Have you considered using a Qualified Charitable Distribution for your charitable giving? Since you take the standard deduction, a QCD could reduce your taxable income by $X while supporting the causes you care about."

**For users approaching year-end:**
> "I see you donated $X last year. If you're planning similar giving this year, we could save $X by bunching two years of donations into one year and using a donor-advised fund."

**For users with concentrated positions:**
> "Your [STOCK] position has grown to X% of your portfolio. If charitable giving is part of your plan, a charitable remainder trust could let you diversify while providing income and supporting your favorite causes."

### Automation Opportunities

Maven should build automated checks for:
1. **Annual giving review** – compare last 3 years, identify bunching opportunities
2. **Cost basis alerts** – flag positions with >100% unrealized gain
3. **Age-based triggers** – 70½ (QCD eligible), 73 (RMD starts)
4. **Income spikes** – flag years where income significantly exceeds prior years
5. **Year-end reminders** – December charitable planning check-in
