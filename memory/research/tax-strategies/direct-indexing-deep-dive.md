# Direct Indexing: Tax Alpha Through Individual Stock Ownership

*Beyond ETFs: How owning individual index components unlocks tax benefits unavailable in packaged products*

---

## Executive Summary

Direct indexing means **owning the individual stocks that make up an index** (like the S&P 500) instead of buying an ETF or mutual fund. This approach unlocks:

- **2x more tax-loss harvesting** vs. ETF-to-ETF harvesting
- **Capital gains harvesting** for 0% bracket taxpayers
- **Optimized charitable giving** (donate highest-gain lots)
- **Personalized exclusions** (ESG, employer restrictions, sector tilts)
- **No fund expense ratios** on the underlying positions

Once only for ultra-wealthy clients ($10M+), direct indexing is now accessible with **$20K-$100K minimums** thanks to zero-commission trading and fractional shares.

## The Evolution of Direct Indexing

### Early Days (1990s-2012)
- Pioneered by **Parametric** and **Aperio** (now BlackRock)
- $20/trade commissions made it expensive
- Required millions to justify costs
- Primarily HNW tax-loss harvesting play

### Robo-Advisor Era (2013-2020)
- **Wealthfront** introduced direct indexing at $500K, later $100K minimum
- Zero-commission trading made mass-market viable
- Still positioned primarily as tax-loss harvesting tool

### Current Era (2021-Present)
- Minimums dropped to **$20K-$50K** (Frec, Wealthfront S&P 500)
- Multiple use cases beyond tax-loss harvesting
- Growing competition: Fidelity FidFolios, Schwab Personalized Indexing, etc.
- Fractional shares enable perfect replication at any account size

## The Four Types of Direct Indexing

### 1. Tax-Focused Direct Indexing

**Primary goal:** Maximize tax alpha through:

**Tax-Loss Harvesting:**
- Sell individual stocks at a loss even when index is up
- S&P 500 up for the year? 150+ component stocks may still be down
- ETF can't pass through those losses — direct indexing can
- Daily harvesting algorithms scan for opportunities

**Capital Gains Harvesting:**
- For taxpayers in 10%/12% brackets: 0% long-term capital gains rate
- Sell individual winners, immediately repurchase (no wash sale on gains)
- Free step-up in basis
- Particularly valuable for retirees pre-Social Security

**Optimized Charitable Giving:**
- Donate highest-gain individual lots to DAF or charity
- Get full FMV deduction, no capital gains tax
- Immediately repurchase position (no wash sale)
- New shares have higher basis

**Basis Management at Death:**
- Hold lowest-basis shares for step-up at death
- Sell higher-basis shares for rebalancing during life
- Direct indexing enables lot-level control

### 2. Personalized (ESG/SRI) Direct Indexing

**Primary goal:** Customize index to personal values

- Exclude fossil fuel companies
- Exclude weapons manufacturers
- Overweight clean energy
- Avoid specific companies (controversial practices)
- Custom ESG screens

**Advantages over ESG mutual funds:**
- Define YOUR criteria, not fund manager's
- No management fees beyond platform fee
- Still capture tax-loss harvesting benefits
- Transparent holdings at all times

### 3. Rules-Based Direct Indexing

**Primary goal:** Implement custom investment strategies

Advisors can overlay rules on broad market exposure:
- Factor tilts (value, momentum, quality)
- Sector over/underweights
- Market cap adjustments
- Custom screening criteria

**Why this matters:**
- Avoid paying ETF fees for factor exposure
- Combine tax management with strategy
- Full transparency and control
- No black-box fund decisions

### 4. Customized Completion Portfolios

**Primary goal:** Build around existing positions

For clients with:
- Concentrated stock positions (employer stock)
- Restricted securities
- Legacy holdings with low basis
- Employment restrictions (e.g., can't hold competitors)

Direct indexing builds a **completion portfolio**:
- Exclude the concentrated position's sector/industry
- Maintain market exposure without overlap
- Reduce concentration risk tax-efficiently

## Tax-Loss Harvesting Deep Dive

### How It Works

1. **Daily scanning** — Algorithm identifies positions with unrealized losses
2. **Sell at loss** — Realize the loss for tax purposes
3. **Reinvest proceeds** — Buy similar (not substantially identical) stocks
4. **Track wash sales** — Avoid 30-day repurchase of same security

### Expected Tax Alpha

| Provider | Claimed Tax Harvesting |
|----------|----------------------|
| Frec | ~45% of portfolio value over 10 years |
| Wealthfront | 2x ETF-to-ETF harvesting |
| Industry average | 1.5-2.5% annually (declining over time) |

### Realistic Expectations

**Early years:** Higher harvesting as positions establish
- Fresh portfolio = all shares near current basis
- Volatility creates frequent opportunities

**Later years:** Diminishing opportunities
- Most positions "bought down" to lower basis
- Need new contributions or market volatility
- Tax deferral benefit compounds

### The Embedded Gain Problem

Tax-loss harvesting is **tax deferral, not elimination**:
- Every harvest lowers cost basis
- Eventually, gains must be recognized
- Works best when:
  - Tax rates expected to decrease in future
  - Time value of money favors deferral
  - Position held until death (step-up)

## Direct Indexing Provider Comparison

### Fee Comparison (2025-2026)

| Provider | Minimum | Fee | Direct Indexing % |
|----------|---------|-----|-------------------|
| **Frec** | $20K-$50K | 0.09%-0.35% | 100% |
| **Wealthfront** | $20K (S&P), $100K (Total) | 0.09%-0.25% | Partial (ETF blend) |
| **Fidelity FidFolios** | $5K | 0.40% | 100% |
| **Schwab Personalized** | $100K | 0.35%-0.40% | 100% |
| **Parametric** | $250K+ | Varies (advisor) | 100% |
| **Aperio (BlackRock)** | $500K+ | Varies (advisor) | 100% |

### Index Options

## Implementation Considerations

### Tracking Error

Direct indexing **will not perfectly match** the benchmark index:
- Tax-loss harvesting creates temporary divergence
- Customizations (exclusions) create permanent divergence
- Rounding/fractional shares add minor variance

**Expected tracking error:** <1% annually for well-run programs

### Trading Costs

Modern platforms: **$0 commissions**
- No per-trade cost
- No ticket charges
- Fractional shares minimize cash drag

Hidden costs to consider:
- Bid-ask spreads on individual stocks
- Tax lot accounting complexity

### Administrative Complexity

**Benefits of automation:**
- Algorithm handles all trades
- Tax lot tracking automatic
- Wash sale monitoring built-in

**Potential issues:**
- Many 1099-Bs (hundreds of positions)
- Tax prep may be more complex
- Cost basis tracking across accounts

## When Direct Indexing Makes Sense

### Strong Candidates

1. **High-income earners** — Maximum benefit from loss harvesting (37%+ bracket)
2. **Charitably inclined** — Optimize which lots to donate
3. **Concentrated positions** — Build completion portfolio
4. **ESG-focused** — Want specific customization
5. **Long time horizon** — More time for tax alpha to compound
6. **Taxable accounts** — Tax benefits only apply in taxable

### Poor Candidates

1. **Tax-advantaged accounts** — No benefit to loss harvesting in IRA/401k
2. **Low tax bracket** — Limited benefit from harvesting
3. **Short time horizon** — Administrative costs may exceed benefits
4. **Very small accounts** — Minimum thresholds + diminishing returns

## Direct Indexing vs. ETF Cost Analysis

### 30-Year Projection: $100K Initial Investment, 8% Returns

| Approach | Annual Cost | 30-Year Ending Value |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) | 0.03% | $997,177 |
| Frec Direct Index | 0.09% | $978,685 |
| Fidelity FidFolios | 0.40% | $900,260 |

**But this ignores tax alpha:**

If direct indexing generates 1%/year in tax savings:
- 30-year effective return: 9% vs. 8%
- Ending value: $1,326,768 vs. $997,177
- **Tax alpha more than offsets fee difference**

---

## Advanced Tax Strategies with Direct Indexing

### 1. Charitable Giving Optimization

**Strategy:**
- Identify lots with largest unrealized gains
- Donate to DAF or charity (full FMV deduction, no cap gains)
- Immediately repurchase same stock
- New higher basis reduces future gains

**Why direct indexing enables this:**
- Can cherry-pick specific lots
- ETF donation = average basis across all shares

### 2. Tax Bracket Management

**Strategy:**
- Harvest enough losses to offset gains elsewhere
- Or harvest gains if in 0% bracket
- Precise control over realized gains/losses

### 3. Asset Location Coordination

**Strategy:**
- Hold direct index in taxable account (for harvesting)
- Hold bonds in tax-advantaged accounts
- Coordinate lot selection with overall tax plan

### 4. Estate Planning Integration

**Strategy:**
- Identify lowest-basis lots for step-up at death
- Sell higher-basis lots during life for rebalancing
- Direct indexing enables lot-level control impossible with ETFs
