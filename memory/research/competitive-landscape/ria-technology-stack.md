# RIA Technology Landscape Research

## 5. Client Portals

**Current State:**

- Often tied to platform (Orion, Tamarac, Black Diamond, Advyzon all have native portals)
- Account aggregation becoming table stakes
- Mobile experience increasingly important

**Client Expectations (especially younger):**
- Real-time account visibility
- Goal tracking & progress visualization
- Document vault
- Secure messaging
- Mobile-first design
- Seamless aggregation of held-away accounts
- Modern, consumer-grade UX (think Robinhood, not 1990s)

**Gap:** 91% of wealthy clients want estate planning advice, only 22% receive it. Portals don't typically surface planning insights proactively.

---

## 6. Major Pain Points RIAs Face

### 1. **Integration Fragmentation (71% cite as top frustration)**
- Data doesn't flow between systems
- Manual re-entry across platforms
- Reconciliation nightmares
- "Frankenstack" problem

### 2. **Data Aggregation & Quality**
- #1 factor in tech selection (Cerulli 2024)
- Held-away accounts difficult to aggregate
- Data latency issues
- Alternative investments particularly challenging

### 3. **Onboarding & Implementation**
- Complex setups (especially Salesforce, Black Diamond)
- Data migration painful
- Training burden

### 4. **Cost & Value**
- Enterprise tools expensive for small/mid RIAs
- Unclear ROI
- Per-user pricing adds up quickly

### 5. **Outdated UX**
- Legacy interfaces
- Not mobile-optimized
- Client portals feel like afterthoughts

### 6. **Compliance & Cybersecurity**
- Only 58% use cybersecurity software (alarming)
- Compliance features often bolted on, not native

### 7. **Scalability**
- Tools that work for 50 clients break at 500
- Enterprise features priced out of reach

---

## 7. AI Integration in Wealth Management

### Current State (2024-2025)
- **54%** believe AI will have greatest impact on industry growth
- **Only 23%** have implemented AI at their own firm
- **~60%** use at least one AI-enabled feature

### Primary AI Use Cases

**1. Note-Taking & Meeting Summaries (#1 application)**
- Tools: Wealthbox AI notetaker, FinMate, Jump
- PreciseFP saved 198,012 hours in 2025 via automation

- Drafting emails, newsletters
- ChatGPT, Claude usage high
- Compliance review of AI-generated content still manual

**3. Data Entry & Document Processing**
- Holistiplan OCR for tax returns

### Emerging AI Applications
- Portfolio optimization

### AI Integration Gap
Most AI is "bolted on" via standalone tools. **No major platform has deeply integrated AI into the core workflow yet.**

---

## 8. Gaps in the Market Maven Could Fill

### 🎯 **1. True AI-Native Platform**
No incumbent has AI deeply integrated into every workflow. They're adding AI features, but it's not core to the architecture. A platform built AI-first could:
- Auto-generate meeting prep
- Surface tax-loss harvesting opportunities proactively
- Analyze client communication sentiment
- Predict client needs/churn
- Automate compliance review

### 🎯 **2. Modern Client Experience**
Client portals are afterthoughts. Opportunity for:
- Consumer-grade mobile experience
- Proactive insights pushed to clients
- Interactive planning visualizations
- Family/household collaboration features
- Estate planning visibility (huge gap: 91% want it, 22% get it)

### 🎯 **3. UHNW/Complex Client Segment**
Advyzon just launched Auria for this. Market still underserved for:
- Alternative investment tracking
- Multi-entity management
- Family office features
- Private investment reporting
- Concentrated stock management

### 🎯 **4. Next-Gen Advisor Experience**
Younger advisors expect:
- Mobile-first workflow
- Intuitive UX (not trained, discovered)
- Social/collaborative features
- Transparent, simple pricing

### 🎯 **5. Integration-First Architecture**
Instead of fighting fragmentation, embrace it:
- Open APIs that actually work
- Pre-built integrations that don't break
- Data normalization layer
- Custodian-agnostic from day one

### 🎯 **6. Compliance Built-In, Not Bolted On**
- Automated compliance workflows
- AI-powered review
- Audit trail by design
- Cybersecurity native

### 🎯 **7. Planning + Investment Integration**
Most planning tools don't connect well to portfolio management. Opportunity to:
- Real-time plan updates based on portfolio changes
- Automatic rebalancing triggers from planning scenarios
- Tax-aware planning that connects to trading

### 🎯 **8. Smaller RIA Sweet Spot**
Large players focus on enterprise. Small/solo RIAs underserved:
- Affordable all-in-one solution
- No implementation partner needed
- Quick time-to-value
