## Competitive Observations

### From Research: Key Differentiators

| Feature | Maven Opportunity | Competitor Gap |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| Tax-equivalent yield | Real-time, integrated | Static calculators only |
| Bond ladder builder | Tax-aware, multi-account | Single-account only |
| Estate tax projection | Dynamic "what-if" | Static estimates |
| Basis tracking | Cross-account, lifetime | Transaction-based only |
| Gifting strategy | Holistic planning | Transactional focus |

### Market Positioning

**Maven's advantage:** Combine wealth aggregation (all accounts) with intelligent tax optimization and planning tools.

**Most competitors:**
- Wealth managers: Manual planning, high fees
- Robo-advisors: No tax optimization depth
- Tax software: No wealth integration
- Estate planners: One-time engagement, no ongoing tool

**Maven can own:** The intersection of wealth data + tax optimization + ongoing planning.
