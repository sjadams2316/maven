# Maven Competitor Analysis
*Research Date: 2026-02-05*

## The Big Picture: Why Current Tools Fail

The wealth management software landscape is **fragmented by design**. Advisors are forced to piece together 5-10 different tools:
- CRM (Redtail, Wealthbox, Salesforce)
- Financial Planning (eMoney, MoneyGuidePro, RightCapital)
- Portfolio Management (Orion, Black Diamond, Addepar)
- Risk Assessment (Riskalyze)
- Trading/Rebalancing (Orion, iRebal)
- Client Portal (each vendor has their own)
- Reporting (often separate)

**The integration tax is massive.** Advisors spend hours reconciling data across systems.

## BlackRock Aladdin: The Gold Standard (and Why)

### What Aladdin Actually Does Well:
1. **Unified Data Language** - Everything speaks the same protocol. No data reconciliation headaches.
2. **Risk Analytics at Scale** - Institutional-grade risk models that actually work
3. **Pre + Post Investment Integration** - Just acquired Preqin/eFront to unify private markets
4. **AI Commentary Generator** - "Auto Commentary" turns complex analytics into client-ready narratives
5. **Cross-Asset Class Coverage** - Handles alternatives, private markets, not just stocks/bonds

### Why Advisors Can't Have Aladdin:
- Enterprise pricing ($100K+/year minimum)
- Designed for institutional scale (billions, not millions)
- Integration complexity requires dedicated IT teams

### **Maven Opportunity**: Build Aladdin for the $10M-$500M AUM range. Same unified data layer, AI-powered insights, but priced for independent RIAs.

## Orion Advisor Technology

### Strengths:
- 100+ integrations - plays nicely with everything
- Strong trading/rebalancing
- Solid portfolio analytics
- Client portal that doesn't suck
- $15,000+/year pricing proves advisors will pay for good tools

### Weaknesses:
- **Overwhelming complexity** - Takes months to implement properly
- Still requires separate planning software
- Reporting is functional but not beautiful
- Mobile experience is an afterthought

### Key Insight:
> Orion could charge $15,000/year while MoneyGuidePro can't even charge $1,500/year
> — Michael Kitces

**Translation**: Advisors pay premium for portfolio management because that's where revenue is generated. Planning software is seen as overhead.

## MoneyGuidePro

### Strengths:
- Easy-to-use goal-based planning
- Clear visuals for client meetings
- Industry standard (everyone knows it)

### Weaknesses:
- Low perceived value ($1,500/year pricing ceiling)
- Siloed from portfolio management
- Not truly integrated with anything
- Planning = one-time document, not living relationship

### **Maven Opportunity**: Make planning DYNAMIC. Plans that update automatically with market changes, life events, and portfolio performance.

---

## Riskalyze (Risk Assessment)

### What They Got Right:
- Simple risk number concept clients understand
- Good visualizations
- Decent adoption

### What They Got Wrong:
- Standalone tool that doesn't evolve the relationship
- Risk tolerance ≠ actual portfolio behavior
- Static assessment, not dynamic monitoring

---

## Robo-Advisors: Where They Fall Short

### Wealthfront/Betterment Limitations:
1. **No human touch when you need it** - Premium tier ($100K+) required for CFP access
2. **BBB F Rating (Wealthfront)** - Customer service is automated to a fault
3. **Fractional share issues** - Wealthfront doesn't offer fractional ETFs, causing allocation drift
4. **Black box investing** - "Trust us" without transparency
5. **Limited customization** - One-size-fits-all portfolios

### Personal Capital (Now Empower):
- Better hybrid model with human advisors
- But: High minimums, still feels like a bank product

### **Maven Opportunity**: AI-first but human-accessible. The sophistication of a robo with the personalization of a boutique advisor.

## What Advisors Actually Complain About

From Reddit CFP community and industry research:

### Top Pain Points:
1. **Data reconciliation across systems** - Hours wasted making sure numbers match
2. **Report generation** - 26 hours average for comprehensive financial report
3. **Manual meeting prep** - Gathering data from 5 different systems
4. **Client onboarding friction** - Too many forms, too much back-and-forth
5. **Compliance documentation** - Paper trail requirements eat time
6. **Software that doesn't talk to each other** - The integration nightmare

### Specific Frustrations:
- "Schwab/Fidelity integrations break constantly"
- "Why do I need 3 logins to see one client's full picture?"
- "Reporting looks like it's from 2005"
- "Mobile apps are useless for anything serious"

## Pricing Intelligence

| Platform | Annual Cost | Value Perception |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Orion | $15,000+ | "Worth it" - revenue-generating |
| eMoney | $4,000-$5,000 | "Expensive but necessary" |
| MoneyGuidePro | $1,200-$1,500 | "Commodity" |
| Riskalyze | $3,000-$5,000 | "Nice to have" |
| Redtail CRM | $1,200-$2,400 | "Table stakes" |

**Total advisor tech spend: $20,000-$30,000/year** for a well-equipped practice

### **Maven Pricing Sweet Spot**: $500/month ($6,000/year) for individual advisors, replacing 3-4 tools. $300-$400/advisor/month for teams.
