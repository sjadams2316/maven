## The Truth About How Advisors Spend Time

### Average Lead Advisor Week (43 hours):

| Activity | Hours/Week | % of Time |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Client Meetings | 8.8 | 20% |
| Meeting Prep | 5.3 | 12% |
| Planning/Analysis | 6.6 | 15% |
| Client Servicing | 6.0 | 14% |
| Prospecting/Meetings | 9.0 | 21% |
| Investment Management | 5.5 | 13% |
| Administrative | 4.2 | 10% |
| Professional Dev | 3.2 | 7% |
| Management | 4.7 | 11% |

**Shocking stat**: Advisors spend **only 20% of their time actually meeting with clients**.

Another shocker: **22 hours/week on administrative tasks** (according to other research)

## RIA vs Broker-Dealer Time Allocation

### RIA Advisors:
- 71 average clients
- 5.4 meeting hours per client/year (3-4 meetings)
- 16.8 total hours per client/year
- Less prospecting (16% of time)
- More depth per relationship

### Broker-Dealer Advisors:
- 118 average clients  
- 3.6 meeting hours per client/year
- 10.2 total hours per client/year
- More prospecting (24% of time)
- Volume over depth

### **Insight**: RIA model allows for deeper relationships but capacity is limited. AI can extend capacity without sacrificing depth.

## The Meeting Prep Problem

## Implementation Insight

### Technology Alone Doesn't Save Time

From Kitces research:
> "Solo firms investing more heavily in tech tools designed for administrative work do not consistently spend less time on this work."

**Why?** Technology enables advisors to do MORE, not necessarily FASTER. They expand service depth rather than increase client count.

### **Maven Implication**: Position as "do more for each client" not "handle more clients." Quality over quantity messaging resonates with advisor values.
