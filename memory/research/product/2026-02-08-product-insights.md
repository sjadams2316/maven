# Product Innovation Insights — February 8, 2026

*Ideas from today's research that could make Maven indispensable*

---

## Big Picture Observations

### 1. The "Completion Portfolio" Opportunity

From direct indexing research: Many HNW clients have **concentrated positions** (employer stock, founders, executives) and need help building around them.

**Maven opportunity:**
- Integrate concentrated position analysis with portfolio construction
- "Build Me a Completion Portfolio" feature
- Show how Maven-recommended holdings complement (not overlap with) concentrated positions
- Direct indexing providers like Frec charge 0.09%+ for this — Maven could guide the strategy

### 2. Tax Alpha is Becoming Table Stakes

Every competitor (Wealthfront, Fidelity, Schwab, robo-advisors) now offers some form of tax-loss harvesting. But most do it within silos.

**Maven differentiation:**
- **Cross-account tax coordination** — No one else does this well
- See all accounts (taxable, IRA, 401k, spouse) in one view
- Coordinate harvesting to avoid wash sales across accounts
- Recommend which account to harvest from

### 3. The "40-Year Advisor" Test

From research agenda philosophy: Maven's advice should make a 40-year veteran advisor nod.

**What that means in practice:**
- VPFs, GRATs, exchange funds — Maven should understand these
- Not just define them, but **recommend when they're appropriate**
- "You have $5M in concentrated AAPL. Here are your options..." ranked by suitability

## Feature Ideas from Today's Research

### A. Concentrated Position Optimizer 2.0

Current Concentrated Position Lab is good. Based on research, enhancements:

1. **Strategy Comparison Matrix**
   - VPF vs. Exchange Fund vs. GRAT vs. Charitable Trust vs. Direct Sale
   - Model each strategy with client's actual numbers
   - Show tax impact, liquidity timeline, upside/downside

2. **VPF Scenario Modeler**
   - Input: Stock value, basis, volatility, dividend yield
   - Output: Projected prepayment at various floor/cap combinations
   - Compare providers (Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Cache)

3. **Corporate Policy Checker**
   - "Are you an insider with trading restrictions?"
   - If yes, flag VPF and other hedging limitations
   - Suggest compliant alternatives

### B. GRAT Planning Module

Estate planning is currently light in Maven. Add:

1. **GRAT Scenario Calculator**
   - Asset value, term, 7520 rate
   - Model at different growth rates
   - Show "break-even" growth rate

2. **7520 Rate Dashboard**
   - Current rate + historical trend
   - Alert when rates favorable for funding
   - "GRAT Opportunity Score" (based on rate environment + client assets)

3. **Rolling GRAT Scheduler**
   - Plan sequential GRATs
   - Track annuity payment timing
   - Cumulative wealth transfer projection

### C. Direct Indexing Evaluator

Maven doesn't do custody/trading, but can advise:

1. **"Is Direct Indexing Right for Me?"**
   - Input: Tax bracket, account size, time horizon
   - Output: Estimated annual tax alpha vs. costs
   - Recommendation: Yes/No and provider comparison

2. **Charitable Giving + Direct Index Integration**
   - For clients using direct indexing elsewhere
   - Import holdings, identify optimal lots to donate
   - Coordinate with DAF recommendations

## UX Insights from Competitive Research

### From AI Wealth Management Landscape Research (completed yesterday)

1. **Wealthfront's weakness:** No human touch. Maven can bridge AI + human advisor relationship.

2. **Betterment's weakness:** Generic advice. Maven's personalization could differentiate.

3. **Family Office services:** The bar for HNW experience is:
   - Proactive outreach ("Here's what you should be thinking about...")
   - Coordinated advice across tax/estate/investments
   - Access to sophisticated strategies

### From Client Psychology Research (completed yesterday)

1. **Trust factors:** Transparency, education, consistent communication
   - Maven's "show your work" reasoning is a strength
   - Add: "Why we recommend this" explanations

2. **Wealth anxiety themes:** "Am I doing enough?" "What am I missing?"
   - Maven could do proactive alerts: "Based on your profile, you may want to consider..."
   - Checklist features: "Wealth Optimization Score" — are you using all available strategies?

## Competitive Moat Ideas

### 1. Cross-Account Intelligence

No one does this well:
- See all accounts in one place
- Tax-loss harvesting coordination
- Asset location optimization across the household
- Wash sale prevention across spouse/IRA/etc.

**If Maven cracks this, it's a massive moat.**

### 2. Life Event Triggers

From client research: People need advice most during transitions.
- Inheritance received
- Stock options vesting
- IPO/acquisition
- Divorce
- Retirement

**Maven feature:** Life event intake → personalized action plan
"I just inherited $500K" → Step-by-step guide (asset location, Roth conversion opportunity, etc.)

### 3. The "Oracle" as True Advisor

Current Oracle is chat-based Q&A. Could evolve to:
- **Proactive insights**: "I noticed your AAPL position is now 25% of portfolio. Here's what that means..."
- **Strategy recommendations**: Based on profile + market conditions
- **Planning checkups**: Annual/quarterly review with action items

---

## Quick Wins (Low Effort, High Value)

1. **Add 7520 rate to Oracle knowledge**
   - Users ask about GRATs, we should know current rate
   - Monthly update

2. **VPF explainer in Concentrated Position Lab**
   - Most users don't know this exists
   - "Did you know? For positions over $1M, Variable Prepaid Forwards can..."

3. **"Tax Alpha" dashboard**
   - Show estimated tax savings from Maven recommendations
   - YTD, lifetime, projected
   - Creates stickiness and proves value

---

## Research Gaps to Fill

Based on today's research agenda review:

**Still needed for comprehensive wealth management:**
1. Prepaid Variable Forwards — ✅ DONE TODAY
2. GRATs — ✅ DONE TODAY
3. Direct Indexing — ✅ DONE TODAY
4. **CRTs, CLTs, private foundations** — Next session
5. **Installment sales (IRC 453)** — Useful for business sales
6. **QOZ (Qualified Opportunity Zones)** — Tax deferral play
7. **Life insurance strategies (ILITs)** — Estate planning
8. **Generation-skipping strategies** — Dynasty planning

---

## Summary: Today's Top 3 Product Ideas

1. **Concentrated Position Optimizer 2.0** — Add VPF modeling, strategy comparison matrix, corporate policy checker

2. **GRAT Planning Module** — Scenario calculator, 7520 rate dashboard, rolling GRAT scheduler

3. **Cross-Account Tax Coordination** — The unsexy but powerful moat. No one else does this well.
