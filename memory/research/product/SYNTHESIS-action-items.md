# Maven Product Strategy: Synthesis & Action Items
*Research Date: 2026-02-05*

## The Core Thesis

**Maven should be the Aladdin that independent advisors can actually afford.**

BlackRock's Aladdin proves the model: unified data, AI-powered insights, comprehensive coverage. But it's priced for institutions managing billions. Maven can deliver 80% of the value at 1% of the price for the $10M-$500M AUM advisor market.

## What Would Make Maven Worth $500/Month

### The Time Equation:
- Average advisor wastes 10+ hours/week on admin, data reconciliation, and meeting prep
- At $200/hour opportunity cost = $8,000/month of wasted time
- Maven needs to reclaim 5-7 hours to justify $500

### Specific Time-Saving Features:

| Feature | Time Saved/Week | Priority |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| One-click meeting prep | 2-3 hours | CRITICAL |
| Automated reporting | 2-3 hours | CRITICAL |
| Single-login data access | 1-2 hours | HIGH |
| AI draft communications | 1 hour | HIGH |
| Smart alerts (vs manual monitoring) | 1 hour | MEDIUM |

### Revenue-Generating Features:
- Better client retention (comprehensive service)
- Win more prospects (modern tech stack)
- Serve more clients (capacity increase)
- Deeper relationships (proactive insights)

## The 10 Things That Would Make Advisors Tell Everyone

### 1. **Morning Briefing**
Every day: "Here's what changed for your clients overnight, what needs attention, and your optimized schedule."

### 2. **One-Click Beautiful Reports**
Reports that clients actually want to look at. Personalized narratives, not boilerplate.

### 3. **AI Meeting Prep**
Talking points generated based on portfolio drift, tax opportunities, life milestones, and conversation history.

### 4. **Unified Data (Finally)**
All accounts, all custodians, held-away assets, real estate, everything in one view.

### 5. **Client Portal That Wows**
When clients show friends: "Look what my advisor gave me access to."

### 6. **Proactive Tax Intelligence**
"You have a $4,500 tax-loss harvesting opportunity expiring in 3 days."

### 7. **Advisor Community**
Real peer support, not just software. Anonymous case discussion, benchmarking, best practices.

### 8. **Mobile That Works**
Actual functionality on phone, not just "download the app."

### 9. **Compliance Made Easy**
Audit trails, documentation, ADV disclosures handled.

### 10. **Continuous Innovation**
Monthly releases with new capabilities. "Did you see what Maven added?"
