# Emerging Opportunities: The Future of Wealth
*Research Date: 2026-02-05*

## What's Coming That Advisors Aren't Thinking About

### The 10-Year Wealth Transfer
- **$84 trillion** transferring to younger generations
- Gen Z/Millennials expect digital-first experiences
- Traditional advisor models won't survive unchanged
- Trust in institutions declining, trust in technology rising

**Maven Positioning**: Be the platform the next generation expects

---

## 1. Crypto/DeFi Integration for Traditional Portfolios

### Current State:
- Morgan Stanley now allows Bitcoin ETF recommendations
- Spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $50B+ AUM in first year
- Most advisors still avoiding crypto entirely

### The Opportunity Gap:
Clients want exposure. Advisors don't know how to provide it safely.

### What Maven Should Build:

**Phase 1: Visibility**
- Track crypto holdings from exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken via API)
- Include in net worth calculations
- Show correlation with traditional portfolio
- Risk analysis that includes crypto volatility

**Phase 2: Guidance**
- Position sizing recommendations (2-5% max typically)
- Tax-loss harvesting for crypto (wash sale rules don't apply... yet)
- DeFi yield opportunities with risk ratings
- Staking income tracking and reporting

**Phase 3: Integration**
- Crypto ETF recommendations within portfolio
- Auto-rebalancing that includes crypto allocation
- Tax-optimized crypto/traditional transitions

### Risk Considerations:
- Regulatory uncertainty
- Custody questions
- Volatility impact on plans
- Client education needed

## 2. AI Agents Managing Money Autonomously

### The Trajectory:
2024: AI generates recommendations for human approval
2025: AI executes within tight parameters (rebalancing, TLH)
2026: AI handles routine optimization autonomously
2027+: AI manages toward goals with minimal intervention

### What This Means for Maven:

**Near-Term (Build Now):**
- Permission system for autonomous actions
- Graduated autonomy levels (Manual → Notify → Execute)
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Clear boundary definitions

**Medium-Term (Design Now):**
- Goal-based AI agents: "Maintain retirement trajectory"
- Multi-objective optimization: "Balance tax, risk, return"
- Life event response: "Adjust for divorce, inheritance"

**Long-Term (Vision):**
> "Maven, I want to retire at 60 with $100K/year income. Handle it."
> 
> AI: Manages investments, insurance, Social Security timing, tax strategies, estate planning, and regular human check-ins.

### Building Blocks Needed:
1. Goal formalization system
2. Risk tolerance monitoring (not just setting)
3. Life event detection
4. Regulatory compliance automation
5. Human escalation triggers

## 3. Bittensor and Decentralized AI

### What Is Bittensor?
- Decentralized network of AI models competing to provide best outputs
- TAO token rewards best-performing AI
- 129+ subnets for different AI tasks
- Now EVM compatible (smart contracts on AI network)

### Potential Applications for Maven:

**Market Intelligence Subnet:**
- Tap into decentralized market analysis
- Multiple competing models, best answer wins
- Potentially better than single-provider AI

**Financial Planning Subnet:**
- Scenario modeling at scale
- Crowd-sourced optimization strategies
- Novel approaches from global AI contributors

**Risk Assessment Subnet:**
- Alternative risk models
- Black swan detection
- Correlation analysis

### The Play:
Don't build all AI in-house. Leverage decentralized AI for specialized tasks. Keep core product and user experience proprietary.

### Risks:
- Still early/experimental
- Quality varies by subnet
- Regulatory uncertainty
- Integration complexity

## 4. Social/Community Features for Advisors

### The Insight:
Advisors are isolated. They want to learn from peers but have no safe space to do so.

### What Exists:
- XYPN community for fee-only planners
- AGC (Advisor Growth Community) - paid community
- Reddit r/CFP - unstructured
- Conference networking - sporadic

### What's Missing:
- Real-time peer collaboration
- Anonymous case discussion
- Best practice sharing
- Business benchmarking

### Maven Community Features:

**For Advisors:**
1. **Anonymous Case Forum**
   - "Client situation: [anonymized]. What would you do?"
   - Upvote best responses
   - Tag by specialty (divorce, business sale, etc.)

2. **Practice Benchmarking**
   - "How does my client retention compare?"
   - "What's average revenue per client in my segment?"
   - Anonymous, opt-in data sharing

3. **Resource Sharing**
   - Email templates that work
   - Meeting agendas
   - Client education materials
   - Compliance documentation

4. **Live Office Hours**
   - Expert advisors available for questions
   - Specialty topics (estate planning, tax, etc.)
   - Paid experts, free access for Maven users

**Why This Builds a Moat:**
- Network effects (more advisors = more value)
- Switching cost (community relationships)
- Proprietary data from interactions
- Brand loyalty through belonging

---

## 5. Next-Gen Client Experience

### What Gen Z Expects:

1. **Social Proof**
   - "Here's how people like you invest"
   - Trend visibility (not individual data)
   - Community validation

2. **Gamification** (careful)
   - Progress toward goals
   - Achievement milestones
   - Not: trading gamification (that's bad)

3. **Values Integration**
   - ESG as default option
   - Carbon footprint tracking
   - Impact visualization

4. **Voice/Chat Interface**
   - "Hey Maven, how am I doing?"
   - No navigation, just conversation
   - Always available

5. **Instant Everything**
   - Open accounts in minutes
   - Transfer money immediately
   - Get answers now, not "I'll email you"

---

## 6. Insurance as Part of the Plan

### The Current Gap:
Advisors manage investments. Insurance is separate conversation (if at all).

### The Opportunity:
Holistic wealth = Investment + Insurance + Protection

### Features to Build:

1. **Life Insurance Analysis**
   - How much do you need? (AI calculation)
   - Are you overpaying? (policy comparison)
   - Term vs permanent recommendation
   - Integrate with estate plan

2. **Long-Term Care Planning**
   - Cost projections by region
   - Insurance vs self-insure analysis
   - Medicaid planning considerations

3. **Property/Casualty Optimization**
   - Umbrella coverage recommendations
   - Home/auto coordination
   - Risk gap identification

4. **Insurance in Estate Planning**
   - ILIT strategies
   - Tax-efficient wealth transfer
   - Business succession funding

### Business Model:
Referral relationships with insurance carriers. Transparent fee disclosure. Advisory model, not sales.

---

## 7. Business Owner Specialization

### The Underserved Market:
Business owners have complex needs:
- Business valuation
- Exit planning
- Succession strategy
- Tax optimization (QSBS, etc.)
- Key person insurance
- Buy-sell agreements
- 401(k) administration

### Most Advisors Can't Help:
Too complex, too specialized, too liability-risky.

### Maven Opportunity:

**Business Wealth Module:**
- Estimated business value tracking
- Scenario modeling for exits
- Tax impact of different strategies
- Integration with personal financial plan

**Expert Network:**
- Vetted business valuation professionals
- M&A advisors
- Tax specialists (CPA/attorney referrals)
- Exit planning consultants

**Why This Wins:**
- Higher AUM clients (business owners are wealthy)
- Sticky relationships (complex needs)
- Premium pricing justified
- Referral flywheel (business owners know business owners)

## 8. The Family Office Lite Model

### Traditional Family Office: 
$100M+ to justify dedicated staff

### The Gap:
$5M-$50M families have complex needs but can't afford full family office.

### Maven as Virtual Family Office:

**Services:**
- Consolidated reporting across all assets
- Family governance documentation
- Next-gen education resources
- Philanthropy planning
- Family meeting facilitation
- Concierge referral network

**Technology:**
- Multi-generational dashboard
- Beneficiary tracking
- Document vault with sharing
- Family communication tools

**Premium Tier:**
$1,000-$2,500/month for "Family Office Lite" positioning.

## 9. The Embedded Finance Play

### What If Maven Powered Other Products?

**B2B2C Opportunities:**
- Banks wanting wealth management capability
- CPAs wanting to add planning
- Attorneys wanting estate planning tools
- Employers wanting financial wellness

**White-Label Strategy:**
- Maven engine, their brand
- Revenue share model
- Massive scale potential

**Risk:**
- Brand dilution

## The North Star

**What would make someone pay $500/month?**
→ Time back in their day (10+ hours/month)
→ Revenue impact (win more clients, retain better)
→ Competitive necessity (everyone else will have it)

**What would make them tell every advisor they know?**
→ Community that's actually valuable
→ Features that make them look cutting-edge to clients
→ Support that treats them like partners
→ Continuous innovation they can show off

**Build for the advisor who wants to be excellent**, not the advisor who wants to do the minimum. Premium positioning, premium product, premium community.
