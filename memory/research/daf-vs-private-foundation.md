## The Bunching Strategy (The Real Play)

### The Problem
Standard deduction for 2025:
- Single: $15,000
- MFJ: $30,000

If your itemized deductions (mortgage interest, SALT, charity) are close to the standard deduction, you're getting **zero benefit** from charitable giving.

### The Solution: Bunch Multiple Years

**Instead of giving $10,000/year for 3 years:**
- Year 1: $10,000 → Itemize at ~$25,000 total → Standard deduction wins
- Year 2: $10,000 → Same result
- Year 3: $10,000 → Same result
- **Net tax benefit: Zero**

**Bunch into DAF:**
- Year 1: $30,000 to DAF → Itemize at ~$45,000 → Excess over standard: $15,000 deduction
- Year 2: $0 giving → Take standard deduction
- Year 3: $0 giving → Take standard deduction
- **Net tax benefit: $15,000 × tax rate**

### The DAF Advantage
Grant from DAF to charities over time. You get the deduction NOW, distribute LATER.

## Appreciated Stock Donation (Double Win)

### The Strategy
Instead of:
1. Selling stock → Pay capital gains tax
2. Donating cash → Get deduction

Do this:
1. Donate appreciated stock directly to DAF → No capital gains tax
2. Get full fair market value deduction

### The Math
Stock purchased for $10,000, now worth $50,000.

**Sell then donate:**
- Capital gains: $40,000 × 23.8% = $9,520 tax
- Cash donated: $40,480
- Deduction: $40,480

**Donate stock directly:**
- Capital gains tax: $0
- Deduction: $50,000
- **Extra tax benefit: $9,520 + extra $9,520 deduction value**

### Works With
- Publicly traded stocks
- Mutual funds
- Some DAFs accept: real estate, private stock, crypto, art

## When to Use DAF

✅ **You want simplicity** — No legal entity, no board, no filings
✅ **Anonymous giving** — Grants don't appear on public record
✅ **Tax timing arbitrage** — Big deduction year, distribute later
✅ **Appreciated asset liquidation** — Avoid capital gains
✅ **Assets under ~$2M for philanthropy** — Not worth foundation overhead
✅ **Variable income** — Bunch in high-income years

---

## When to Use Private Foundation

✅ **Assets exceed $2-5M** — Overhead becomes reasonable
✅ **Want to employ family** — Pay reasonable compensation
✅ **Legacy/dynasty giving** — Multi-generational family involvement
✅ **Control matters** — You make final decisions, not sponsor
✅ **Direct scholarships** — Pay individuals, not just organizations
✅ **International giving** — More flexibility than DAFs
✅ **Investment control** — Self-direct portfolio

DAF has better deduction limits. Donate to DAF, then grant to foundation if needed.

### Scenario 3: Training Ground
Give next generation DAF experience before foundation board responsibility.

### Scenario 4: Meeting Distribution Requirements
Foundation must distribute 5% annually. Grant to DAF to meet requirement, distribute from DAF later.

## Mind-Blowing Facts for Clients

> "You can donate $100,000 of appreciated stock to a DAF, pay zero capital gains tax, get a full $100,000 deduction, and distribute $10,000 to charities each year for the next decade. Your charity receives the same amount, you get the deduction this year, and the government never sees a dime of capital gains."

> "A DAF with $500,000 growing at 7% generates $35,000/year. If you distribute $25,000 annually, the account grows forever. It's perpetual charitable giving powered by your original tax-advantaged contribution."
