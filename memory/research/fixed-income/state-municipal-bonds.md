## Executive Summary

Municipal bonds offer federal tax exemption on interest income, and **in-state bonds typically provide state tax exemption as well** ("double tax-free"). For residents of high-tax states, this creates significant after-tax yield advantages. Understanding state-specific rules, AMT implications, and breakeven analysis is critical for proper asset allocation.

## 2. California Municipal Bonds

### Tax Rates (2025)

- **Top Marginal Rate**: 13.3% (income >$1M)
- **High-Earner Bracket**: 12.3% (income >$677K single / >$1.35M MFJ)
- **Combined Fed + CA Rate**: Up to 54.1% (37% + 3.8% NIIT + 13.3%)

### California Rules

**Key Points:**
1. Interest from CA municipal bonds is **exempt from California personal income tax**
2. Interest from out-of-state municipal bonds is **fully taxable** in California
3. California does NOT provide reciprocal exemptions for other states' bonds
4. US Treasury and federal agency obligations are **exempt** from CA tax (per federal law)

**CA Tax Code Reference**: Revenue and Taxation Code Section 17133

### Taxable Equivalent Yield Calculator for CA Residents

For a CA resident in top brackets:
```
Taxable Equivalent Yield = Muni Yield / (1 - Combined Tax Rate)

Example: 4.0% CA muni yield
Combined rate: 37% federal + 3.8% NIIT + 13.3% CA = 54.1%
TEY = 4.0% / (1 - 0.541) = 4.0% / 0.459 = 8.71%
```

### California Muni Market Characteristics

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Market Size** | ~$480B outstanding; largest state muni market |
| **Credit Quality** | Generally strong; state AA- rated (S&P) |
| **Yield Spread** | Typically trades 5-20 bps tighter than national munis |
| **Diversification** | Limited single-state exposure risk |

### CA-Specific Considerations

- **Proposition 13**: Property tax limitations create unique municipal finance dynamics
- **Local Agency Revenue Bonds**: Various water/utility districts with varying credit quality
- **GO vs Revenue**: Heavy revenue bond issuance from state agencies
- **Concentration Risk**: 14% of US economy; recession-correlated risks

## 3. New York Municipal Bonds

### Tax Rates (2025)

- **NYS Top Rate**: 10.9% (income >$25M)
- **NYC Additional**: 3.876% (top bracket)
- **Combined Max**: 51.8% (37% + 10.9% + 3.876%)

### New York Rules

**Key Points:**
1. NYS municipal bond interest is **exempt from NY state and NYC income taxes**
2. Out-of-state municipal bonds are **fully taxable** at state and city levels
3. NYC residents can achieve **"triple tax-free"** status: federal + state + city
4. NY-specific funds can provide triple-tax-free income

**Triple Tax-Free Calculation (NYC Resident):**
```
Taxable Equivalent Yield = Muni Yield / (1 - Combined Rate)

Example: 4.0% NY muni yield
Combined: 37% + 3.8% + 10.9% + 3.876% = 55.58%
TEY = 4.0% / (1 - 0.5558) = 4.0% / 0.4442 = 9.00%
```

### NY Tax Code Reference

- NY Tax Law § 612(c)(1): Interest from NY municipal obligations excluded from NY AGI
- NYC Admin Code § 11-1712: NYC tax exemption for state/local obligations

### New York Muni Market Characteristics

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Market Size** | ~$400B outstanding; second largest market |
| **Issuers** | MTA, TBTA, Triborough Bridge, NY Housing |
| **Credit Mix** | Range from AAA to below investment grade |
| **NYC Focus** | Heavy concentration in NYC-related issuers |

### NY-Specific Considerations

- **MTA Bonds**: Large issuer; tied to NYC transit system finances
- **Tobacco Settlement Bonds**: Variable credit quality
- **Industrial Development Agencies**: Various local IDA issuances
- **NYC General Obligation**: Strong credits; direct city backing

## 4. New Jersey Municipal Bonds

### Tax Rates (2025)

- **Top NJ Rate**: 10.75% (income >$1M)
- **Combined Max**: 51.55% (37% + 3.8% + 10.75%)

### New Jersey Rules

**Key Points:**
1. Interest from NJ municipal bonds is **exempt from NJ Gross Income Tax**
2. Out-of-state municipal bonds are **taxable** in New Jersey
3. US Treasury obligations are **exempt** from NJ tax
4. Gains from selling NJ municipal bonds ARE taxable (only interest exempt)

**NJ Tax Exemption Sources:**
- N.J.S.A. 54A:6-14: Interest and gains from NJ obligations exempt
- NJ Division of Taxation GIT-5 publication

### Taxable Equivalent Yield (NJ Resident)

```
Example: 4.0% NJ muni yield
Combined: 37% + 3.8% + 10.75% = 51.55%
TEY = 4.0% / (1 - 0.5155) = 4.0% / 0.4845 = 8.26%
```

### New Jersey Muni Market Characteristics

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Market Size** | ~$55B outstanding; mid-sized market |
| **Credit Issues** | State has had credit challenges; pension liabilities |
| **GO Bonds** | Rated A- to BBB+ by major agencies |
| **Concentration** | Limited diversification within state |

### NJ-Specific Considerations

- **Credit Quality**: NJ has faced pension and budget stress; higher risk than CA/NY
- **Smaller Market**: Less liquidity; may need to look at national munis
- **County/Local Variation**: Credit quality varies significantly by locality
- **Transportation Trust Fund**: Key issuer for infrastructure bonds

## 5. Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Considerations

### AMT and Municipal Bonds

**Private Activity Bonds (PABs)** are subject to AMT:
- Interest included in Alternative Minimum Taxable Income (AMTI)
- Can create AMT liability for high-income investors

### 2025 AMT Thresholds

| Filing Status | Exemption | Phase-out Begins |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| Single | $88,100 | $626,350 |
| MFJ | $137,000 | $1,252,700 |

### AMT Bond Strategy

**For High-Income Investors:**
1. **Check AMT Status**: If already in AMT, PAB interest costs nothing extra
2. **Avoid PABs If**: Close to AMT threshold but not over
3. **AMT-Free Funds**: Specifically avoid PABs; may sacrifice yield

**AMT-Free Bond Types:**
- Governmental bonds (schools, roads, etc.)
- 501(c)(3) qualified bonds (hospitals, universities)
- Single-family mortgage revenue bonds
- Multifamily housing bonds

---

## 6. In-State vs. Out-of-State Decision Framework

### Breakeven Analysis

**When do in-state bonds make sense?**

```
Breakeven Yield = Out-of-State Yield × (1 - State Tax Rate)

Example (CA resident, 13.3% state rate):
If out-of-state muni yields 4.5%
Breakeven CA yield = 4.5% × (1 - 0.133) = 3.90%

If CA muni yields >3.90%, buy CA
If CA muni yields <3.90%, consider out-of-state
```

### Factors Favoring In-State Bonds

- High state/local tax rate (CA, NY, NJ, etc.)
- Large liquid market (CA, NY have deep markets)
- Strong state credit quality
- Long holding period (full tax benefit)

### Factors Favoring National/Out-of-State Bonds

- Low state tax rate (TX, FL, WA, NV = 0%)
- Small in-state market (limited diversification)
- Weak state credit quality
- Significant yield pickup on out-of-state bonds
- AMT concerns (national funds may avoid PABs)

### State Tax Rate Comparison

| State | Top Rate | Muni Strategy |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| California | 13.3% | Strong in-state preference |
| New York | 10.9% (+NYC) | Strong in-state preference |
| New Jersey | 10.75% | Moderate in-state preference |
| Texas | 0% | National bonds preferred |
| Florida | 0% | National bonds preferred |
| Washington | 0% | National bonds preferred |
| Nevada | 0% | National bonds preferred |

## 7. Implementation Approaches

### Individual Bonds vs. Funds

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Individual Bonds** | Full control; ladder construction; hold to maturity | Requires expertise; minimum trade sizes; less diversification |
| **State-Specific Mutual Funds** | Professional management; diversification | Fees; less control; perpetual duration |
| **State-Specific ETFs** | Low cost; liquidity | May not exist for all states; tracking error |
| **National Muni Funds** | Maximum diversification | Lose state tax benefit on out-of-state portion |

- Vanguard California Long-Term Tax-Exempt (VCITX)
- Fidelity California Municipal Income (FCTFX)

**New York:**
