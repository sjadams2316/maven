# Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) Planning
*Research compiled: 2026-02-05*

## The Alpha Most Advisors Miss

The 3.8% NIIT is a stealth tax that high earners pay without realizing there are legal ways to reduce or eliminate it. Real estate professionals, business owners, and sophisticated investors can often avoid this tax entirely.

---

## NIIT Basics

### What It Is
A 3.8% surtax on the **lesser of:**
1. Net investment income, OR
2. Amount by which MAGI exceeds threshold

### Income Thresholds (Not Indexed for Inflation)
| Filing Status | Threshold |
|--------------|-----------|
| Single | $200,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $250,000 |
| Married Filing Separately | $125,000 |
| Estates/Trusts | ~$15,650 (2025) |

**The Cliff:** Once you cross the threshold, NIIT applies to investment income. It's not gradual — it's a cliff.

## What Counts as Net Investment Income

### ✅ Subject to NIIT
- Interest (taxable)
- Dividends (qualified and ordinary)
- Capital gains (short and long-term)
- Rental income (passive)
- Royalties
- Annuity distributions (taxable portion)
- Passive business income (S-corps, partnerships)
- Trading profits for non-traders

### ❌ NOT Subject to NIIT
- Wages and self-employment income
- **Active business income** (material participation)
- Tax-exempt interest (municipal bonds)
- Distributions from qualified retirement plans (401k, IRA)
- Social Security benefits
- Life insurance proceeds
- **Rental income from real estate professionals**

---

## Strategy 1: MAGI Reduction

### Max Out Tax-Deferred Accounts
Every dollar to 401(k), Traditional IRA, or HSA reduces MAGI.

**Impact:** $23,500 to 401(k) = $893 NIIT savings (if fully in NIIT zone)

### Health Savings Account
HSA contributions reduce MAGI AND grow tax-free.

**Family limit:** $8,550 (2025) = $325 NIIT savings

### Charitable Bunching
Big charitable deductions reduce AGI (not MAGI for most items, but charitable contributions flow through).

Use DAF for timing control.

---

## Strategy 2: Convert Investment Income to Active Income

### The Material Participation Loophole
Business income where you **materially participate** is NOT net investment income.

**Material Participation Tests (meet ANY one):**
1. 500+ hours in the activity
2. Substantially all participation is yours
3. 100+ hours AND no one else participates more
4. Significant participation activities totaling 500+ hours
5. Materially participated in 5 of last 10 years
6. Personal service activity with any 3 prior years participation
7. Regular, continuous, and substantial participation

### Practical Application
Turn passive investments into active businesses:
- Passive rental income → Active real estate professional
- Passive business ownership → Active management role
- Passive trading → Qualified trader status

---

## Strategy 3: Real Estate Professional Exception (The Big One)

### The Exception
If you qualify as a **real estate professional**, rental income is NOT automatically passive.

**Requirements:**
1. More than 50% of personal services in real property trades/businesses
2. More than 750 hours annually in real property activities
3. Material participation in each rental activity (or grouping election)

### The Grouping Election
You can elect to treat all rental activities as a single activity for material participation purposes.

**Why This Matters:** Instead of proving 500+ hours in EACH property, prove it for ALL properties combined.

**File with first return claiming election. Cannot revoke without IRS permission.**

### Who Qualifies
- Full-time real estate agents/brokers (with rentals)
- Property managers (with own rentals)
- Real estate developers
- Landlords who self-manage extensively
- Spouses who manage rentals full-time

**Trap:** W-2 employees in other fields rarely qualify (50% test)

### Documentation Critical
Keep detailed time logs:
- Date, activity, hours, property
- Contemporaneous records (not reconstructed)
- Reasonable and consistent methodology

---

## Strategy 4: Tax-Exempt Income Positioning

### Municipal Bonds
Municipal bond interest is excluded from net investment income.

**Double benefit:**
1. No federal income tax
2. No NIIT

**After-tax comparison for MFJ in 37% bracket + NIIT:**
- Taxable bond at 5%: 5% × (1 - 0.37 - 0.038) = 2.96% after-tax
- Muni bond at 3.5%: 3.5% after-tax

Munis win at lower yields for high earners.

### Tax-Loss Harvesting
Capital losses offset capital gains (NIIT component).

Harvest losses systematically to reduce net gains subject to NIIT.

---

## Strategy 5: Retirement Account Asset Location

### The Problem
Investment income in taxable accounts faces:
- Income tax (up to 37% + state)
- NIIT (3.8%)
- Total: 40.8%+ on ordinary investment income

### The Solution
Place income-generating assets in retirement accounts:
- High-yield bonds → 401(k)/IRA
- REITs → 401(k)/IRA
- Dividend stocks → 401(k)/IRA

Growth assets in taxable accounts:
- Index funds (low dividends)
- Tax-efficient ETFs
- Long-term hold positions

---

## Strategy 6: Installment Sales

### Spread Gains Over Multiple Years
Instead of recognizing all capital gain in one year (potentially pushing into NIIT zone), use installment sales.

**Benefits:**
- Spread gain recognition over payment period
- May keep some years below threshold
- NIIT applies only to gain recognized each year

**Works for:**
- Real estate sales
- Business sales
- Private stock sales

---

## Strategy 7: Qualified Opportunity Zone Investment

### The NIIT Play
Defer and potentially reduce capital gains through QOZ investment.

**Benefits:**
- Defer original gain (and NIIT) until 2026 or sale
- If held 10+ years, NO tax on QOZ investment appreciation
- NO NIIT on appreciation if held 10+ years

---

## Strategy 8: Trader Status Election

### Who Qualifies
If you trade frequently enough to be classified as a "trader" (vs investor), trading income becomes business income.

**Requirements (facts and circumstances):**
- Substantial trading activity
- Seeking profit from short-term movements
- Regular and frequent transactions
- Significant time devoted to trading

**Benefits:**
- Trading gains = business income (no NIIT)
- Business expense deductions available
- Mark-to-market election available

**Warning:** Strict requirements. Casual day trading doesn't qualify.

---

## Trust Planning (Compressed Brackets)

### The Problem
Trusts hit NIIT threshold at only ~$15,650 (2025).

**Result:** Most trust investment income faces NIIT.

### Solutions
1. **Distribute income to beneficiaries** — Shifts NIIT to their (likely higher) thresholds
2. **Intentionally defective grantor trusts** — Income taxed to grantor, uses grantor's threshold
3. **Charitable remainder trusts** — Convert to income stream + charitable deduction

## Mind-Blowing Facts for Clients

> "A real estate professional with $200,000 in rental income pays $0 in NIIT. The same $200,000 as passive rental income for someone else costs $7,600 in NIIT alone. That's the difference between qualifying and not qualifying."

> "Moving $500,000 in REITs from a taxable account to a 401(k) could save $19,000 in NIIT over time — that's on top of the income tax deferral. Asset location isn't just about deferral, it's about avoiding the 3.8% entirely."

> "The NIIT thresholds haven't changed since 2013. They're not indexed for inflation. Every year, more middle-class families get caught by this 'high earner' tax because $250,000 isn't what it used to be."

## NIIT Calculator Logic

```
If MAGI > Threshold:
  Excess = MAGI - Threshold
  NIIT Base = min(Net Investment Income, Excess)
  NIIT = NIIT Base × 3.8%
Else:
  NIIT = $0
```

**Example:**
- MAGI: $350,000 (MFJ)
- Net Investment Income: $80,000
- Threshold: $250,000
- Excess: $100,000
- NIIT Base: min($80,000, $100,000) = $80,000
- **NIIT: $3,040**
