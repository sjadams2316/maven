## What Happened

On **February 10, 2026**, Altruist launched major upgrades to **Hazel**, its AI assistant for RIAs. The key capability: automated tax planning that can ingest unstructured data (emails, PDF tax returns, handwritten notes) and generate personalized tax strategies in minutes. Priced at ~$100/user/month.

## Market Impact

- **LPL Financial (LPLA)** dropped **8.3%** (11% intraday low) — not on earnings, purely on Altruist's announcement
- **Billions erased** across wealth management stocks in 48 hours
- Media calling it a **"Sputnik moment"** for the industry
- Investors fear AI is shifting from productivity tool → replacement for high-value advice

## Why It Matters

- Tax planning was considered a "moat" for human advisors — Hazel commoditizes it
- **$100/month** undercuts enterprise tax planning tools dramatically
- CEO Jason Wenk positioned it as removing "mentally exhausting" admin work
- Growing "displacement anxiety" — AI threatening the fee structures that justify 1% AUM

## Implications for Maven

1. **MASSIVE VALIDATION** — Maven is building exactly this. The market reaction proves AI wealth management is not hypothetical anymore.
2. **Altruist meeting next week** — Sam has an intro call with Altruist week of 2/17. This changes the dynamic entirely. Altruist just proved they're serious about AI-native wealth management. Partnership potential is higher than ever.
3. **Competitive positioning** — Maven needs to differentiate from Hazel:
   - Hazel = AI assistant bolt-on to custodial platform
   - Maven = full AI-native wealth OS with multi-model intelligence (Athena)
   - Maven's edge: holistic (not just tax), advisor-controlled UX, Bittensor signals
4. **Urgency** — The window for "first AI-native wealth platform" is closing. Altruist has distribution (they're the custodian). Maven has depth and independence.
5. **LPL vulnerability** — 32,000 advisors on a legacy platform now looking scared. Potential customer base for Maven Pro.

*This is the biggest wealthtech news since we started Maven. Sam needs to see this before the Altruist call.*
