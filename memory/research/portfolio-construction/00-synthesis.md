# Portfolio Construction & Optimization: Synthesis

## Executive Summary

This research synthesizes institutional approaches to portfolio construction from major asset managers (Vanguard, BlackRock, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and others). The key finding: **portfolio construction is both art and science**—quantitative frameworks provide the foundation, but judgment, constraints, and client-specific factors shape actual implementation.

## Core Findings

### 1. Methodologies Converge on Similar Principles

Despite different branding and models, major firms share fundamental approaches:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Risk-based thinking | Consider risk contribution, not just capital weights |
| Distributional forecasts | Focus on ranges, not point estimates |
| Multi-asset diversification | Combine uncorrelated return streams |
| Long-term horizon | 10+ year strategic allocations |
| Systematic rebalancing | Rules-based discipline |

### 2. Capital Market Assumptions Are Directional, Not Precise

**Current consensus (2025 CMAs)**:
- U.S. equities: 6-7% expected returns (below historical 10%)
- International equities: Slightly higher expected returns than U.S.
- Fixed income: 4-5% (higher than recent past)
- Private equity: 9-10% with illiquidity premium
- Real estate: 7-8% ("generational opportunity")

**Key insight**: CMAs have wide confidence intervals. A 6% expected return could easily realize as 2% or 12% over 10 years.

### 3. The 60/40 Portfolio Has Evolved, Not Died

Traditional 60/40 was declared dead multiple times but remains relevant:
- Expected returns: ~6.4% (JPM 2025)
- Now enhanced with alternatives (14-30% institutional)
- Fixed income provides meaningful income again
- Still anchors most client portfolios

### 4. Risk Parity Offers a Different Perspective

Risk parity's insight: **balance risk, not capital**:
- 60/40 is actually ~90% equity risk
- True diversification requires risk balancing
- Leverage can be appropriate to achieve target returns
- Works best when correlations are stable

### 5. Factor Investing Is Real but Requires Patience

Established factors (value, size, momentum, quality):
- Have academic and practical support
- But can underperform for extended periods
- Require long horizons and diversified exposure
- Implementation matters as much as selection

### 6. Tax Management Creates Real Alpha

For taxable investors:
- Direct indexing: 1-2% tax alpha potential
- Tax-aware rebalancing: Significant savings
- Asset location: Right asset in right account
- Loss harvesting: Systematic approach works

### 7. AI/ML Is a Tool, Not a Revolution

Current AI applications:
- ✅ Alternative data processing
- ✅ Execution optimization  
- ✅ Risk modeling
- ❌ Long-term return prediction
- ❌ Replacing human judgment

## Decision Framework for Maven

### Portfolio Construction Process

```
1. UNDERSTAND CLIENT
   ├── Goals and time horizon
   ├── Risk tolerance (willingness + ability)
   ├── Constraints (liquidity, taxes, ESG, etc.)
   └── Current holdings and situation

2. SET STRATEGIC ALLOCATION
   ├── Start with CMAs as baseline
   ├── Determine equity/bond split based on risk tolerance
   ├── Consider alternatives allocation (if appropriate)
   ├── Set international allocation
   └── Document in Investment Policy Statement

3. IMPLEMENT
   ├── Select vehicles (funds, ETFs, individual securities)
   ├── Consider factors/tilts if appropriate
   ├── Account for tax efficiency
   └── Execute with minimal market impact

4. MAINTAIN
   ├── Monitor for drift
   ├── Rebalance using threshold approach
   ├── Tax-loss harvest when opportunities arise
   ├── Review annually (or when circumstances change)
   └── Adjust for new CMAs periodically
```

### Key Questions to Ask

**For allocation decisions**:
- What's the required return to meet goals?
- What's the maximum drawdown the client can tolerate?
- What's the time horizon before funds are needed?
- Are there specific constraints (ESG, sector, etc.)?

**For implementation**:
- Is this a taxable or tax-advantaged account?
- What's the starting portfolio vs. target?
- What's the optimal transition path?
- How should rebalancing be handled?

## Future Research Topics

Based on this research, these areas warrant deeper investigation:

### High Priority
1. **Tax-Efficient Portfolio Transitions** - How to move from current to target portfolio minimizing tax
2. **Factor Implementation Details** - Specific vehicle selection, timing, and combination strategies
3. **Alternative Access for Smaller Portfolios** - Interval funds, semi-liquid structures, democratization

### Medium Priority
4. **ESG Integration** - Practical implementation without sacrificing diversification
5. **Sequence of Returns Risk** - Managing drawdowns in decumulation phase
6. **Behavioral Finance Integration** - How to design portfolios clients will stick with

### Lower Priority / Specialized
7. **Options Overlay Strategies** - Collar, covered call, protective put integration
8. **Crypto Asset Allocation** - If/when appropriate, sizing guidelines
9. **Private Market Manager Selection** - Due diligence frameworks

## Quick Reference

### Asset Allocation Guidelines by Risk Tolerance

| Profile | Equity | Fixed Income | Alternatives | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Conservative | 30-40% | 50-60% | 0-10% | Capital preservation focus |
| Moderate | 50-60% | 30-40% | 5-15% | Balanced growth/income |
| Growth | 70-80% | 15-25% | 10-20% | Higher volatility accepted |
| Aggressive | 85-95% | 0-10% | 15-25% | Maximum growth focus |

### Rebalancing Guidelines

| Level | Threshold | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Major Asset Class | ±5% absolute | Rebalance back to target |
| Sub-Asset Class | ±25% relative | Rebalance back to target |
| Frequency | At least annual | Review even if thresholds not hit |

### Tax Efficiency Hierarchy

1. Use new contributions to rebalance
2. Redirect dividends/distributions
3. Rebalance within tax-advantaged accounts
4. Donate appreciated shares to charity
5. Tax-loss harvest to offset gains
6. Sell highest cost basis lots
7. Consider tax cost vs. risk reduction tradeoff
