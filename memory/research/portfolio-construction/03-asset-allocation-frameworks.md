# Asset Allocation Frameworks

## Strategic vs. Tactical Asset Allocation

### Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA)

**Definition**: Long-term target weights based on investor objectives and risk tolerance.

**Characteristics**:
- 5-10+ year investment horizon
- Based on long-term CMAs
- Reflects client's "policy portfolio"
- Rebalanced back to targets periodically

**How It's Set**:
1. Define investment objectives and constraints
2. Estimate long-term returns, risks, correlations
3. Optimize to find efficient portfolios
4. Select portfolio matching risk tolerance
5. Document in Investment Policy Statement

### Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)

**Definition**: Short-to-medium term deviations from SAA based on market conditions.

**Characteristics**:
- 3 months to 3 years horizon
- Active decision to overweight/underweight
- Attempts to exploit mispricings
- Limited deviation from SAA (typically ±5-10%)

**TAA Signals Used**:
- Valuations (P/E, credit spreads)
- Momentum (price trends)
- Economic indicators (PMI, yield curve)
- Sentiment (positioning, flows)

### Comparison

| Aspect | SAA | TAA |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Time Horizon | Long-term | Short-medium |
| Basis | CMAs, risk tolerance | Market signals |
| Frequency | Review annually | Monthly/quarterly |
| Alpha Source | Diversification | Market timing |
| Implementation | Policy weights | Tilts from policy |

## Determining Equity/Bond Splits

### Traditional Rules

**Age-Based Rule**:
- "100 minus age" in stocks
- Modernized to "120 minus age" given longevity

**Risk-Based Approach**:
- Higher allocation = more volatility accepted
- Match to drawdown tolerance (equity down 50%+)

**Goal-Based Approach**:
- Required return drives allocation
- Probability of achieving goal at different allocations

### Modern Approaches

**Human Capital Integration**:
- Young investors have bond-like human capital → more stocks
- Older investors have less human capital → more bonds
- Industry-specific: finance workers already exposed to equity risk

**Liability-Driven**:
- Match asset duration to liability duration
- Pension funds hedge interest rate risk
- Personal: match to known future expenses

**Risk Parity Influence**:
- Traditional 60/40 is ~90% equity risk
- Some argue for more bonds to balance risk contribution

## Role of Alternatives

### Why Alternatives?

1. **Return Enhancement** - Access to illiquidity premium
2. **Diversification** - Low correlation to public markets
3. **Inflation Protection** - Real assets hedge inflation
4. **Income Generation** - Private credit, real estate

### Alternative Asset Categories

| Category | Return Target | Risk/Liquidity | Role |
|----------|---------------|----------------|------|
| **Private Equity** | 9-12% | High risk, illiquid | Return enhancement |
| **Private Credit** | 7-10% | Medium, illiquid | Income, diversification |
| **Real Estate** | 7-10% | Medium, semi-liquid | Income, inflation hedge |
| **Infrastructure** | 6-8% | Lower, illiquid | Stable income, inflation |
| **Hedge Funds** | 5-8% | Medium, semi-liquid | Diversification, downside |
| **Commodities** | 3-5% | High vol, liquid | Inflation hedge, diversification |

### Institutional Allocations

**Morgan Stanley GIC Guidance**:
- Level 1 (All clients): 14-25% alternatives
- Level 2 (>$10M): 21-30% alternatives

**Endowment Model** (Yale, etc.):
- 50-70% alternatives historically
- Private equity, VC, hedge funds dominant
- Limited traditional equity/bonds

### Implementation Considerations

**Liquidity Management**:
- Match illiquid investments to stable capital
- Maintain cash/liquidity buffers
- Plan for capital calls

**Access**:
- Minimum investments ($250K-$5M+)
- Manager selection critical
- Democratizing through interval funds, ETFs

**Fees**:
- 2/20 historically, declining
- Fee drag reduces net returns
- Need gross alpha to justify

## International Allocation

### The Home Bias Puzzle

**What It Is**: Investors allocate far more to domestic equities than optimal diversification suggests.

**Evidence**:
- U.S. investors hold ~6% foreign vs. optimal ~20-25%
- U.K. investors hold ~18% foreign vs. optimal ~25%+
- Home bias has declined but persists

**Explanations**:
- Information asymmetry (know domestic markets better)
- Currency risk aversion
- Regulatory/tax preferences
- Behavioral familiarity bias

### Optimal International Allocation

**Market Cap Weighting Argument**:
- Global market cap: ~60% U.S., ~40% non-U.S.
- Suggests 40% international for market portfolio

**Diversification Benefit Argument**:
- Correlations < 1 provide diversification
- Optimal may be 30-40% international
- EM adds diversification beyond developed

**Counter-Arguments**:
- U.S. companies have global revenues
- Currency hedging costs/complexity
- Governance/political risks abroad

### Practical Guidelines

**Vanguard Recommendations**:
- 20-40% of equity in international
- Home bias acceptable if understood
- Currency hedging for bonds, not necessarily stocks

**Implementation**:
| Investor Type | Suggested Int'l Equity | Notes |
|---------------|------------------------|-------|
| Conservative | 20-25% | Lower tracking error |
| Moderate | 30-35% | Balanced approach |
| Aggressive | 35-40% | Max diversification |

## Factor Tilts

### Common Factor Tilts

**Value**: Cheap stocks by fundamentals
- P/E, P/B, EV/EBITDA screens
- Long-term premium: ~3% historically
- Requires patience (can underperform for years)

**Size (Small Cap)**: Smaller market cap companies
- Higher expected returns
- Higher volatility
- Less liquidity

**Momentum**: Recent outperformers
- Trend-following signal
- Short-term oriented
- Higher turnover

**Quality**: High profitability, low leverage
- Defensive characteristics
- Lower volatility
- Premium especially in downturns

**Low Volatility**: Lower risk stocks
- Risk-adjusted outperformance
- "Betting against beta"
- Underperforms in strong bull markets

### Factor Integration Approaches

1. **Factor Tilted Indices** - Passive exposure with tilt
2. **Multi-Factor Products** - Combine factors systematically
3. **Active Managers** - Discretionary factor exposure
4. **Factor Timing** - Rotate based on cycle

### Implementation Considerations

- **Factor Crowding** - Popular factors become expensive
- **Transaction Costs** - Some factors require turnover
- **Horizon** - Factors work over long periods, not months
- **Capacity** - Small cap, momentum have limits

## Key Principles

### Asset Allocation Matters Most

Studies consistently show:
- 90%+ of return variability from asset allocation
- Security selection adds at the margin
- Get the big decisions right first

### Risk Tolerance Is Personal

- Questionnaires help but don't capture everything
- Past behavior in downturns most informative
- Willingness AND ability to take risk

### Rebalancing Maintains Discipline

- Without rebalancing, portfolio drifts
- Risk exposure changes over time
- Systematic approach beats emotional

### Simplicity Often Wins

- Complex doesn't mean better
- Transaction costs/taxes compound
- Understandable portfolios are stickable
