# Capital Market Assumptions (CMAs)

## What Are CMAs?

Capital Market Assumptions are long-term (typically 10-15 year) forecasts of expected returns, volatilities, and correlations for various asset classes. They serve as the foundation for strategic asset allocation decisions.

## How Major Firms Build CMAs

### Building Blocks Approach

Most firms decompose expected returns into components:

**Equity Return = Dividend Yield + Earnings Growth + Valuation Change**

**Bond Return = Yield + Roll Return + Spread Change - Defaults**

### Key Inputs

1. **Macro Economic Forecasts** - GDP growth, inflation, monetary policy
2. **Valuation Starting Points** - P/E ratios, credit spreads, real yields
3. **Historical Relationships** - Factor premia, mean reversion tendencies
4. **Structural Changes** - Demographics, technology, deglobalization

### Firm-Specific Methodologies

| Firm | Methodology | Key Features |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Vanguard (VCMM)** | Monte Carlo simulation | 10,000 simulations, full distributions |
| **JPMorgan (LTCMA)** | Building blocks + judgment | 200+ assets, 100+ contributors |
| **BlackRock** | Augmented DCF + structural | Bottom-up earnings, macro integration |
| **Goldman Sachs** | Proprietary models | Shorter-term focus, tactical overlays |

## Key Themes in Current CMAs

### 1. Muted U.S. Equity Returns

**Why**:
- Elevated valuations (1.5-2.0% drag per JPM)
- High profit margins with mean-reversion risk
- Higher interest rates creating competition

**Counterargument**:
- AI productivity boost could justify valuations
- Quality characteristics of U.S. market
- Strong earnings growth potential

### 2. International Equities Look Attractive

**Why**:
- Lower starting valuations
- Currency tailwinds possible
- Cyclical catch-up potential

**Risks**:
- Structural issues (Europe demographics, China governance)
- Currency volatility
- Geopolitical risks

### 3. Fixed Income Renaissance

**Why**:
- Higher starting yields
- Bonds now provide real diversification
- Income component meaningful again

**Considerations**:
- Duration risk in rising rate environment
- Credit spreads historically tight
- Inflation volatility

### 4. Alternatives for Enhancement

**Private Markets**:
- Illiquidity premium of 200-300bps historically
- Access has democratized
- Real estate reset creates opportunity

**Hedge Funds/Liquid Alts**:
- Diversification benefits in regime changes
- Lower correlation with traditional assets
- Higher volatility environment favors active

## Interpreting CMAs

### What CMAs Are Good For

✅ Setting long-term strategic asset allocation
✅ Understanding relative attractiveness of asset classes
✅ Framing return expectations for clients
✅ Stress testing portfolio assumptions

### What CMAs Are NOT Good For

❌ Predicting short-term returns
❌ Market timing decisions
❌ Precise portfolio optimization (estimation error)
❌ Guaranteeing outcomes

### Key Caveats

1. **Wide Confidence Intervals** - 10-year equity returns could range from -2% to +15% per year
2. **Estimation Error** - Forecasts explain only ~40% of actual return variance
3. **Path Dependency** - Same 10-year return can come from very different paths
4. **Regime Changes** - Historical relationships may not persist

---

## How CMAs Differ Across Firms

### Sources of Disagreement

1. **Valuation Models** - How much mean reversion to expect
2. **Macro Assumptions** - Growth, inflation, monetary policy
3. **Factor Premia** - Size, value, momentum persistence
4. **Alternative Asset Returns** - Illiquidity premium, fee drag

### Why They (Mostly) Agree

- All using similar building blocks
- Anchored to similar starting yields/valuations
- Similar historical data sets
- Mutual awareness of each other's work

## Using CMAs in Practice

### For Portfolio Construction

1. **Start with CMAs** as baseline expectations
2. **Apply tilts** based on valuations, momentum, other signals
3. **Account for constraints** (liquidity, taxes, ESG)
4. **Consider ranges** not point estimates
5. **Review periodically** as starting points change

### For Client Conversations

1. **Set realistic expectations** - Don't promise historical returns
2. **Explain uncertainty** - Use ranges and scenarios
3. **Focus on relative value** - Where opportunities lie
4. **Connect to goals** - What returns are needed vs. expected
