# Portfolio Rebalancing Strategies

## Why Rebalancing Matters

### Without Rebalancing

- Portfolio drifts from target allocation
- Risk profile changes over time
- Can become concentrated in winners
- No longer reflects stated risk tolerance

**Example**: 
- Start: 60/40 stocks/bonds
- After 30% stock gain, 5% bond gain: Becomes 65/35
- Risk exposure significantly higher than intended

### Purpose of Rebalancing

1. **Risk Control** - Maintain target risk exposure
2. **Discipline** - Forces buy low, sell high
3. **Alignment** - Keeps portfolio matched to goals
4. **Consistency** - Predictable risk/return profile

## Rebalancing Methods

### Calendar-Based Rebalancing

**Definition**: Rebalance on fixed schedule regardless of drift.

**Common Frequencies**:
- Monthly
- Quarterly
- Semi-annually
- Annually

**Pros**:
- Simple, automatic
- Predictable transaction timing
- Easy to implement

**Cons**:
- May trade unnecessarily
- Misses opportunities between dates
- No response to major market moves

### Threshold-Based Rebalancing

**Definition**: Rebalance when allocations drift beyond set bands.

**Common Thresholds**:
- ±5% absolute deviation at major asset class level
- ±25% relative deviation at sub-asset class level

**Example Bands (BBH approach)**:
| Asset Class | Target | Rebalance Range |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| Total Equity | 62.5% | 57.5% - 67.5% |
| Sub-asset (10%) | 10% | 7.5% - 12.5% |

**Pros**:
- Trades only when meaningful drift
- Responds to market moves
- More efficient than calendar-based

**Cons**:
- Requires monitoring
- Can trigger during volatility clusters
- More complex to implement

### Hybrid Approach

**Combine both methods**:
- Set threshold bands
- But also review at fixed intervals
- Best of both worlds

## Tax-Aware Rebalancing

### The Tax Challenge

Rebalancing often requires selling winners → triggers capital gains taxes.

**Example**:
- Portfolio: $10M (60% equity, 40% bonds)
- Need to sell $1M equity to rebalance
- If 50% gain, creates $500K taxable gain
- At 23.8% rate: $119K tax bill

### Tax-Aware Strategies

**1. Rebalance with New Money**
- Direct new contributions to underweight assets
- No selling required
- Best for accumulation phase

**2. Rebalance with Distributions**
- Redirect dividends, interest, distributions
- Use cash flows instead of selling
- Tax-neutral rebalancing

**3. Charitable Giving**
- Donate appreciated shares to charity
- Deduct fair market value
- Avoid capital gains
- Rebalances portfolio

**4. Asset Location**
- Hold tax-inefficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts
- Rebalance within IRA/401k first (no tax impact)
- Use taxable for tax-efficient assets

**5. Tax-Loss Harvesting**
- Sell losing positions
- Offset gains from rebalancing elsewhere
- Reinvest in similar (not identical) assets

**6. Partial Rebalancing**
- Don't fully rebalance if tax cost too high
- Accept some drift to reduce tax impact
- Focus on highest cost basis lots

### The Rebalancing Tax Tradeoff

**Should you pay taxes to rebalance?**

Consider this scenario:
- Pay $119K tax to rebalance from 60/40
- If market drops 30%, rebalanced portfolio loses $8.6M vs $8.4M unrebalanced
- Difference: $246K saved
- Plus: Rebalanced portfolio can now buy stocks at low prices

**Key Insight**: The contrarian benefit of rebalancing can exceed the tax cost, especially during volatility.

## Transaction Cost Considerations

### Trading Costs

- Commissions (mostly zero now for stocks)
- Bid-ask spreads
- Market impact (large trades)
- Opportunity cost

### Minimizing Costs

1. **Wider bands** - Reduce trading frequency
2. **Limit orders** - Avoid market orders
3. **Low-cost vehicles** - ETFs vs individual stocks
4. **Patient execution** - Trade over time for large amounts

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Don't rebalance if**:
- Drift is minimal
- Transaction costs exceed benefit
- Tax impact outweighs risk reduction
- Just rebalanced recently

## Practical Implementation

### BBH's Recommended Approach

1. **Major Asset Classes**: ±5% absolute band
2. **Sub-Asset Classes**: ±25% relative band
3. **Trigger**: Rebalance when outside bands
4. **Method**: Threshold-based primarily

### Implementation Steps

1. **Before Trading**:
   - Review if IPS has changed
   - Consider tax-advantaged account options
   - Identify highest cost basis lots
   - Check for wash sale implications

2. **Rebalancing Execution**:
   - Use new money first
   - Then tax-advantaged accounts
   - Then taxable with tax efficiency

3. **Documentation**:
   - Record rationale
   - Track cost basis
   - Monitor tax implications

### Special Situations

**Private Markets**:
- Can't easily rebalance illiquid holdings
- Public equivalents may need to overcompensate
- Plan for capital calls

**Concentrated Positions**:
- May need gradual rebalancing
- Tax-managed transition
- Consider exchange funds, collars

**Volatile Markets**:
- Stick to systematic approach
- Don't let emotions override
- Remember: Volatility is when rebalancing adds most value

## Rebalancing Frequency Research

### Academic Findings

**Calendar-based studies**:
- Annual rebalancing captures most benefit
- More frequent adds cost without proportional benefit
- Quarterly is reasonable ceiling

**Threshold-based studies**:
- 5% absolute threshold optimal for most
- Tighter bands increase costs without benefit
- Wider bands increase risk drift

### Optimal Approach

**Evidence suggests**:
- Threshold-based > calendar-based
- 5% bands at asset class level
- Annual review minimum
- Adjust for tax situation

## Key Takeaways

### Do's
✅ Set clear rebalancing bands
✅ Consider taxes before trading
✅ Use new money when possible
✅ Be disciplined in volatile markets
✅ Document your approach

### Don'ts
❌ Rebalance too frequently
❌ Ignore tax implications
❌ Let emotions drive timing
❌ Trade without checking tax-advantaged options
❌ Forget to update IPS when circumstances change

### The Bottom Line

Rebalancing is primarily about **risk control**, not return enhancement. The discipline it enforces—buying low, selling high—can add value, but the main goal is keeping the portfolio aligned with the investor's stated risk tolerance.

Tax-aware execution can significantly improve outcomes for taxable investors. The best rebalancing approach balances risk control against the costs of trading and taxes.
