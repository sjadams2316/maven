*Research compiled February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

After 40 years at Merrill Lynch with approximately $650 million in AUM, Jon Adams sits at a pivotal crosspoint. The economics of independence have never been more favorable, but the transition involves significant complexity. This research provides a comprehensive analysis of the financial, operational, and personal factors involved in a wirehouse-to-independence transition.

**Key Findings:**
- At $650M AUM, Jon is likely generating ~$5-6.5M in annual revenue
- Current Merrill payout: approximately 40-45% (take-home: ~$2-2.9M)
- Independent RIA potential take-home: 60-70% (~$3-4.5M)
- Annual income differential: **$1M-1.5M+ more per year**
- Practice valuation as independent: potentially **$30-50M+ at exit**
- Transition deals available: 150-300%+ of trailing 12-month revenue

## 1. Wirehouse Payout Grids: What Jon Actually Takes Home at Merrill

### Merrill Lynch's Current Compensation Structure (2025-2026)

Merrill Lynch's grid payout rates range from **34% to 51%** based on production levels:

| Annual Production | Grid Payout |
|-------------------|-------------|
| $300,000 - $349,999 | 33-34% |
| $350,000 - $549,999 | 35% |
| $550,000 - $849,999 | 36% |
| $850,000 - $999,999 | 37% |
| $1,000,000 - $1,199,999 | 38% |
| $1,200,000 - $1,749,999 | 39% |
| $1,750,000 - $2,499,999 | 40% |
| $2,500,000+ | 41% |

**Reality Check:** Even top producers rarely exceed 45-50% when factoring in all adjustments, deferrals, and bonuses.

### Jon's Estimated Current Economics

Assuming $650M AUM at ~0.85-1.0% blended fee:
- **Estimated gross production:** $5.5M - $6.5M annually
- **Grid rate:** ~40-41% base
- **Effective take-home after all deductions:** 40-45%
- **Net compensation:** ~$2.2M - $2.9M

**What Merrill Keeps (55-60%):**
- Compliance infrastructure
- Office space and technology
- Administrative support
- Brand/platform costs
- Firm profit margin
- Cross-selling infrastructure costs

## 2. What Wirehouses Actually Keep from Advisors

### The Hidden Costs Embedded in Your Grid

Wirehouses capture significant value in ways most advisors don't fully appreciate:

**1. Direct Revenue Extraction:**
- 55-65% of every dollar produced
- Deferred compensation "clawbacks" (3-5% of production held back)
- Small household penalties (20% reduction for accounts under $500K in 2026)
- Reduced payouts on transferred/house accounts (25% for 12 months)

**2. Product Revenue:**
- Proprietary fund fees and platform payments
- Securities lending income from client holdings
- Cash sweep program interest spread
- Trading desk profits on execution

**3. Relationship Value:**
- Cross-selling referral opportunities (banking, lending, insurance)
- Client data monetization within the enterprise
- Future transition deals from recruiting you elsewhere

**4. Control Mechanisms:**
- Mandatory referral requirements (2+ per year to avoid pay cuts)
- Growth grid requirements that penalize stagnation
- Small account thresholds that force account transfers

### The Cross-Selling Trap

Merrill and other wirehouses incentivize advisors to "sell the enterprise" through products like:
- Wealth Management Banking
- Custom Lending (LMAs)
- Home loans and mortgages
- 529 plans and credit products
- Insurance solutions

**The Problem:** Every product you sell makes your clients stickier to the *firm*, not to you. This dramatically complicates any future departure and reduces your portable asset base.

## 3. Transition Economics: Costs, Timeline, and Client Retention

### Expected Client Retention Rates

Industry data on advisor transitions:

| Transition Type | Expected Asset Retention |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Wirehouse to Wirehouse | 85-95% |
| Wirehouse to Regional BD | 75-90% |
| Wirehouse to Independent BD | 70-85% |
| Wirehouse to RIA | 70-90% |
| Within Broker Protocol | +5-10% retention bonus |

**For Jon at $650M:** Conservative estimate of 75-85% retention = **$490M - $550M in portable assets**

### Factors Affecting Retention

**Positive Retention Factors:**
- Long-tenured relationships (40 years is excellent)
- Fee-based vs. commission-based business (fee-based transfers easier)
- Broker Protocol membership (allows basic client data transfer)
- Personal relationships vs. firm brand dependency
- High-touch service model

**Negative Retention Factors:**
- Clients with multiple bank products (loans, credit, banking)
- Clients who value the Merrill/BofA brand specifically
- Complex held-away assets that don't transfer easily
- Clients nearing life events who don't want disruption

### Transition Costs

**Direct Costs (First 12 Months):**
- Legal/compliance setup: $25,000 - $75,000
- Technology infrastructure: $50,000 - $150,000
- Office space and furniture: $50,000 - $200,000
- Staff hiring/retention: $200,000 - $500,000
- Marketing/branding: $25,000 - $100,000
- Insurance (E&O, etc.): $20,000 - $50,000
- Custodian setup: Minimal (often subsidized)

**Total First-Year Setup:** $400,000 - $1,000,000

**Indirect Costs:**
- Revenue disruption during transition (2-4 months of reduced production)
- Forfeited deferred compensation
- Forfeited unvested transition loan balances
- Time/opportunity cost of transition focus

### Timeline to Full Operation

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Planning & Due Diligence | 3-6 months | Research, platform selection, legal setup |
| Pre-Resignation Preparation | 1-3 months | Documentation, client packet preparation |
| Resignation & Initial Outreach | 48-72 hours | Resign, immediately begin client calls |
| Active Transition | 2-4 months | Account transfers, client meetings |
| Stabilization | 6-12 months | Complete transfers, resolve issues |
| Full Operation | 12+ months | Normal business operations |

## 4. Recruiting Bonuses and Transition Loans

### Current Market for Transition Deals (2024-2026)

The recruiting market remains competitive, with deals ranging significantly by destination:

**Wirehouse to Wirehouse:**
- 150% - 300%+ of trailing 12-month production
- Paid as forgivable loans over 7-13 years
- 50-60% upfront, 40-50% backend/deferred
- Some firms offer partial deferred comp replacement
- Taxed as ordinary income (federal + state ~40-50%)

**To Regional Firms (Raymond James, Stifel, etc.):**
- 200% - 300%+ total deals
- Often more favorable grid (45-50%+)
- Sunset/retirement programs for second monetization
- More flexibility and less compliance burden

**To Independent Models:**
- Traditional IBD deals: 30% - 100% of revenue
- Hybrid RIA platforms: 50% - 150%
- Turn-key RIA platforms with equity: 100% - 200%+
- Pure independence: No upfront deal, but ownership economics

### Deal Structure Components

**1. Upfront Cash (125-175% typical):**
- Immediate liquidity
- Risk-free, regardless of asset retention
- Taxed at 1/9th per year as note forgives

**2. Backend Bonuses (0-50%):**
- Performance-based, tied to growth
- Non-ERISA assets only in many cases
- Harder to achieve "law of large numbers"

**3. Deferred Comp Replacement (0-25%):**
- Only wirehouses typically offer this
- Added on top of normal recruiting deal
- Critical for advisors with significant unvested amounts

**4. Equity Components:**
- Increasingly common in hybrid/RIA deals
- Potential "second bite at the apple"
- Long-term capital gains treatment on exit

### For Jon's Situation ($5.5M+ Production)

**If Moving to Another Wirehouse:**
- Potential deal: 250-300%+ = $13.75M - $16.5M+
- Upfront: ~$7M - $9M
- Backend: $5M - $7M over time
- 9-year note forgiveness period
- Taxed as ordinary income

**If Moving to Regional (Raymond James, etc.):**
- Potential deal: 275-325%
- Better grid (45%+ vs. 40%)
- Sunset program for future monetization
- More autonomy, same support structure

**If Going Independent:**
- No transition deal OR
- Platform deal: 50-150% + equity participation
- Trade cash for ownership and higher ongoing economics

## 5. Independence Economics Comparison

### The "40-35-25 Rule" for Independent RIAs

Typical independent advisory firm economics:

| Category | Percentage of Revenue |
|----------|----------------------|
| Advisor/Investment Team Compensation | 40% |
| Overhead, Admin Staff, Technology | 35% |
| Profit Margin | 25% |

**For a Solo Advisor:** Captures both the 40% and 25% = **65%+ effective payout**

**For Larger Teams:** Similar economics apply, with profit margin going to owners

### Jon's Projected Independent Economics

**Current at Merrill ($6M revenue):**
- Take-home at 42%: $2.52M

**As Independent RIA ($5M revenue after 15% attrition):**

| Expense Category | Amount | % of Revenue |
|------------------|--------|--------------|
| Gross Revenue | $5,000,000 | 100% |
| Custodian/Platform Fees | $100,000 | 2% |
| Technology Stack | $75,000 | 1.5% |
| Compliance/Legal | $100,000 | 2% |
| Office/Overhead | $150,000 | 3% |
| Staff (2-3 people) | $400,000 | 8% |
| Marketing | $50,000 | 1% |
| Insurance | $25,000 | 0.5% |
| **Total Expenses** | **$900,000** | **18%** |
| **Net to Owner** | **$4,100,000** | **82%** |

**Conservative estimate at 65-70% take-home:** $3.25M - $3.5M annually

**Annual Income Improvement:** $700K - $1M+ per year

### 10-Year Economic Comparison

| Model | Annual Take-Home | 10-Year Earnings | Exit Value |
|-------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| Stay at Merrill (40%) | $2.4M | $24M | $0 (no equity) |
| Move to Morgan Stanley (40% + deal) | $2.4M + $14M deal | $38M | $0 |
| Go Independent (70%) | $3.5M | $35M | $30-40M+ |

**Independent Advantage Over 10 Years: $40M-50M+ total value creation**

### The Equity Creation Opportunity

Unlike wirehouse advisors who essentially "rent" their business, independent RIA owners build real enterprise value:

**RIA Valuation Multiples (2024-2025):**

| RIA Type | EBITDA Multiple Range |
|----------|----------------------|
| Small (~$1M EBITDA) | 5.1x - 5.7x |
| Midmarket (~$5M EBITDA) | 6x - 6.8x |
| Large (~$25M EBITDA) | 7x - 8.1x |

**Revenue Multiples:**
- Typical range: 2x - 6x annual revenue
- Premium firms (high growth, HNW focus): 4x - 6x
- Average: 2.8x - 3.3x

**For Jon's Independent Practice:**
- Revenue: $5M
- EBITDA: ~$2M - $2.5M (assuming 40-50% margin)
- Valuation at 6-8x EBITDA: **$12M - $20M**
- Valuation at 3x revenue: **$15M**

**Premium Valuation Factors:**
- High-net-worth client base
- Recurring fee-based revenue
- Strong organic growth
- Systematized operations
- Team depth beyond founder

- Named to Morgan Stanley's Chairman's Club (top 2%)
- Recognized by Barron's and Financial Times

**Motivation:**
- Desire for deeper client planning and connection

- Vision of "doing more and better" for clients

**Execution:**
- Left in April 2017
- Went completely fee-based
- Built own firm from scratch in Houston, Texas

- More than doubled assets to $500M+ within 3 years
- Created conflict-free fiduciary platform
- Wrote book: "Trading Up: Moving From Success to Significance on Wall Street"

**Key Insight:** Going fee-only and leaving commission business behind allowed for cleaner transition and faster growth.

### Case Study 3: $650M Morgan Stanley Team to Hybrid RIA (2020)

- Lee Korn, Jesse Giordano, Joseph Filosa
- Long Island-based team
- $650M in combined assets

**Execution:**

## 8. The "Golden Handcuffs" Problem

### How Deferred Compensation Works

Wirehouses use deferred compensation as a retention mechanism:

**Typical Structure:**
- 3-5% of annual production deferred
- Vests over 5-10 years
- Forfeited upon departure before vesting
- Often paid in company stock

**For Jon (40 years, $6M production):**
- Estimated annual deferral: $180K - $300K
- Accumulated unvested amount: Potentially $500K - $1.5M+
- This is the "golden handcuff"

### Options for Advisors Feeling the Squeeze

**Option 1: Move to Another Wirehouse**
- Recruiting deals (300%+) can offset forfeited deferrals
- Some firms offer partial deferred comp replacement
- Creates new note but fresh start
- UBS and Merrill have reduced recruiting, but others compete

**Option 2: Go Fully Independent**
- Long-term value exceeds short-term forfeitures
- RIA multiples of 6-8x EBITDA far exceed deferred amounts
- Independence creates real equity ownership
- Tax-advantaged exit (capital gains vs. ordinary income)

**Option 3: Quasi-Independence (Hybrid Models)**
- Firms like Rockefeller Capital Management, Dynasty, HighTower
- W2 employment with institutional custody
- Upfront deals often mix of cash and equity
- Greater flexibility than wirehouse, more support than pure independence

### The Math on Walking Away from Deferred Comp

**Scenario: Jon has $1M in unvested deferrals**

| Path | Immediate Impact | 5-Year Outcome |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| Stay at Merrill | Keep $1M deferred | $1M received |
| Move to MS (300% deal) | Lose $1M, gain $16.5M | +$15.5M net |
| Go Independent | Lose $1M, own 100% | +$1M/yr income + equity |

**The deferred comp question usually answers itself when you see the full picture.**

### Recent Legal Developments

Courts have increasingly sided with departing advisors on deferred compensation disputes:

- **Morgan Stanley cases (2024):** Multiple arbitration losses for MS attempting to claw back deferred comp
- The automatic forfeiture of deferred comp upon departure is being challenged
- "Golden handcuffs" are becoming less binding legally

## 10. Conclusion: The Jon Adams Opportunity

After 40 years at Merrill Lynch with $650M in AUM, Jon Adams represents the ideal breakaway candidate:

**Strengths:**
- Long-tenured client relationships
- Substantial asset base to generate economies of scale
- Likely high percentage of fee-based, recurring revenue
- Enough runway to build and potentially sell an independent practice
- Accumulated expertise and credibility

**The Financial Case:**
- Potential annual income increase: $1M+
- 10-year wealth creation: $40-50M+ through income and equity
- Exit value creation: $20-40M (vs. $0 at Merrill)
- Tax-advantaged exit (capital gains vs. ordinary income)

**The Non-Financial Case:**
- True fiduciary status
- Complete control over client experience
- Freedom from corporate mandates
- Legacy and succession on your terms
- Ability to truly serve clients' best interests

**The Question Isn't "Can Jon Afford to Leave?"**
**The Question Is "Can Jon Afford to Stay?"**

Every year at 40-42% payout vs. 65-70% payout represents $500K-$1M+ in foregone income. Every year without equity means no building toward an exit. And the golden handcuffs, while psychologically powerful, pale in comparison to the value creation available through independence.

The path Jon chooses should align with his personal goals, risk tolerance, and vision for the next chapter. But the economics are clear: independence offers a compelling opportunity for an advisor of Jon's caliber.
