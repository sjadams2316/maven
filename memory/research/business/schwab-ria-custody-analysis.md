## Executive Summary

**Schwab is the dominant RIA custodian by a wide margin:**
- **$5+ trillion** in RIA assets under custody
- **16,000+ RIA firms** custody with Schwab
- **3,000+ dedicated professionals** supporting RIAs
- **35+ years** as an RIA custodian
- **No AUM minimums** (unique among major custodians)

**Key Strengths:**
- Brand recognition clients trust
- Open architecture with extensive third-party integrations
- Free commission on US exchange-listed equities and ETFs
- No AUM minimum to get started
- Robust iRebal rebalancing platform included

**Key Weaknesses:**
- Tiered service favoring larger RIAs
- Scattered technology across multiple platforms
- Account-level (not household-level) focus
- Revenue model dependent on cash sweep spreads
- New $5/client block trade fee starting March 2026

**Critical New Development:** Schwab is implementing a **$5 per-client, per-block-trade fee** effective March 2, 2026 for advanced order handling through their Block Desk. This could significantly increase costs for RIAs executing block trades.

## Hidden Costs & Gotchas

### 🚨 The Cash Sweep Revenue Model

**This is how Schwab makes money from "free" custody:**

Schwab earns significant revenue from the **spread** between what they earn on client cash and what they pay clients:
- Client cash swept to Schwab Bank
- Schwab invests at higher rates
- **Net Interest Margin (NIM)** is a primary revenue driver
- In 2025, Schwab had **$425.6 billion** in sweep cash

**Impact:**
- Clients earn below-market rates on cash
- Advisors should minimize cash holdings
- Consider money market funds for large cash positions
- This is a conflict of interest to acknowledge

### Hidden & Overlooked Fees

1. **Block Trade Fee (New March 2026)**
   - $5 per account per block order
   - Could add $50,000+ annually for active traders

2. **Trade-Away Fees**
   - $25 per allocation for executing elsewhere
   - Can impact best execution analysis

3. **Foreign Transaction Fees**
   - $50-75 per trade on foreign securities
   - Plus up to 3% FX conversion markup

4. **Mutual Fund Fees**
   - $24-65 per transaction-fee fund trade
   - Adds up for active fund strategies

5. **ADR Pass-Through Fees**
   - Varies by ADR
   - Automatically deducted
   - Often overlooked in cost analysis

6. **Industry Fees**
   - SEC fees, FINRA fees, options regulatory fees
   - Passed through to clients
   - Variable and often missed

7. **Alternative Investment Custody**
   - $250/position for non-publicly traded securities
   - $500 cap per account
   - Significant for alternative-heavy portfolios

### Service & Operational Gotchas

1. **Tiered Service Reality**
   - Under $100M AUM = lower tier service
   - Less access to specialists
   - Longer resolution times

2. **Technology Fragmentation**
   - Multiple systems for same tasks
   - Inconsistent training
   - "Multiple ways to do everything"

3. **Account vs Household Focus**
   - Operations are account-centric
   - Household-level tasks more manual
   - RMDs, billing, reporting affected

4. **DocuSign Limitations**
   - Three accounts max per envelope
   - Envelope grouping not by signer
   - Firm documents need separate platform

5. **Transition Support Limits**
   - Consultants advise but don't execute
   - Minimal on-site support
   - DIY heavy for smaller firms

6. **Retail Competition**
   - Schwab Intelligent Portfolios competes
   - Retail division priorities may differ
   - Brand confusion potential

### Red Flags from Advisor Feedback

- "If you don't like the answer, call back for a different one"
- "Resigned acceptance" attitude among RIAs
- High turnover in service staff
- Knowledge gaps in support teams
- Slow technology improvements post-TD merger

## Strategic Recommendations

### For a New/Small RIA (<$100M AUM)

**Schwab is the recommended choice because:**

1. **No AUM minimum** - Can start immediately
2. **Brand recognition** - Clients trust the name
3. **Commission-free trading** - Reduces cost drag
4. **iRebal included** - Free rebalancing tool
5. **Open architecture** - Future integration flexibility

**Mitigation strategies for weaknesses:**

1. **Service tier concerns:**
   - Build relationships with your service team
   - Document everything in writing
   - Be prepared for inconsistency
   - Consider ProDirect if rapid growth expected

2. **Cash sweep revenue:**
   - Minimize client cash holdings
   - Use money market funds for large balances
   - Educate clients on cash management

3. **Technology fragmentation:**
   - Choose one workflow and stick with it
   - Invest in third-party tools early (Orion, etc.)
   - Document your processes internally

### Consider a Dual-Custody Strategy

Many RIAs maintain relationships with **two custodians** (~30% of RIAs):

**Benefits:**
- Backup if one has issues
- Negotiate better terms
- Handle different client types
- Risk diversification

**Schwab + Altruist** could work:
- Schwab for larger clients, brand recognition
- Altruist for smaller accounts, modern tech
- Different strengths complement

### Watch These Developments

1. **Block Trade Fee (March 2026)**
   - Monitor implementation
   - Calculate impact on your trading style
   - May warrant execution strategy changes

2. **TD Ameritrade Integration**
   - Technology consolidation ongoing
   - Watch for platform improvements
   - iRebal likely to evolve

3. **Cash Sweep Rates**
   - Monitor competitive rates
   - Advocate for better client rates
   - Consider Flourish Cash or alternatives

4. **Alternative Custodians**
   - Altruist growing rapidly (111.7% YoY)
   - Interactive Brokers for sophisticated needs
   - TradePMR for niche requirements

### Due Diligence Checklist

Before finalizing Schwab:

- [ ] Request detailed pricing schedule
- [ ] Understand your service tier
- [ ] Clarify block trade fee applicability
- [ ] Test Advisor Center demo
- [ ] Verify integration requirements
