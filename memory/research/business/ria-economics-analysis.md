# RIA Economics Deep Dive: Does This Business Model Work?

*Research compiled: February 7, 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

The RIA (Registered Investment Advisor) business model **can be highly profitable** but requires significant scale and operational discipline to achieve target margins. Key findings:

- **Top-performing RIAs achieve 30-40%+ operating margins**; average firms struggle at 18-25%
- **Breakeven requires ~$10-15M AUM** for a solo practitioner; ~$30-50M for a small team
- **Fee compression is real**: median blended AUM fee is 1% on first $1M, declining to 0.50% on $5M+
- **Economies of scale kick in around $100M AUM**, accelerating significantly at $500M+
- **Technology is the great equalizer**: tech-forward firms outperform at every size tier
- **Client acquisition is expensive**: average CAC of $3,119, but lifetime value makes it worthwhile

**Verdict**: The RIA model works well for disciplined operators who can reach scale. Tech-forward approaches dramatically improve unit economics at every stage.

## 1. Revenue Per Client Benchmarks by AUM Tier

### AUM Fee Structures (2024 Kitces Report)

| Client AUM | Median Fee Rate | Annual Revenue/Client |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| $250K | 1.00% - 1.15% | $2,500 - $2,875 |

| $10M+ | 0.50% | $50,000+ |

### Fee Schedule Types

**Graduated Schedule (most common):**
- $0 - $1M: 1.00%
- $1M - $2.5M: 0.80%
- $2.5M - $5M: 0.65%
- $5M+: 0.50%

**Cliff Schedule (less common):**

## 2. Operating Margin Analysis

### Industry Benchmarks

| Firm Size (AUM) | Average Operating Margin | Top Performers |
|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| <$100M | 15-20% | 25-30% |
| $100M - $250M | 20-25% | 30-35% |
| $250M - $500M | 25-30% | 35-40% |
| $500M - $1B | 28-33% | 40-45% |
| $1B+ | 30-35% | 43%+ |

### 2024 Industry Reality (Fidelity Benchmarking)

**Concerning trend**: Smaller RIAs (<$1B AUM) saw operating margins hit historic lows in 2024:
- Advisory expenses reached **82% of revenue** in 2023
- Leaving only **18% operating margin** — a record low
- Driven by: rising expenses, falling AUM per client, lower revenue per advisor

**Top performers (InvestmentNews Study)**:
- Top-performing firms: **43.5% operating profit margin**
- All other firms: **19.1% operating margin**
- **Target recommendation**: 25-35% operating income

### What Drives Margin Differences?

**High-margin firms (30%+) typically:**
- Serve higher-AUM clients (less clients per dollar managed)
- Heavy technology adoption
- Efficient workflows and automation
- Niche focus = premium pricing
- Strong organic growth (lower CAC as % of revenue)

**Low-margin firms (<20%) typically:**
- Overserving small accounts
- Manual processes and poor tech utilization
- Generalist positioning = commodity pricing
- High advisor time spent on admin

## 4. Breakeven AUM Levels

### Solo Practitioner Breakeven

**Assumptions:**
- Minimal overhead (home office)
- $5,000-10,000 startup costs
- $50,000-75,000 personal income requirement
- 1% average fee

**Breakeven math:**

| Personal Income Need | Required Revenue (at 50% margin) | Required AUM |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| $50,000 | $100,000 | $10M |
| $75,000 | $150,000 | $15M |
| $100,000 | $200,000 | $20M |

**Reality check**: Most solo practitioners can reach profitability at **$10-15M AUM** if running lean.

### Small Team Breakeven (2-3 people)

**Assumptions:**
- Small office or hybrid
- 2-3 staff (lead advisor, ops person, maybe junior advisor)
- Total fixed costs: $200,000-300,000/year

| Fixed Costs | Required Revenue (at 30% margin) | Required AUM |
|-------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
| $200,000 | $285,000 | $28.5M |
| $250,000 | $357,000 | $35.7M |
| $300,000 | $428,000 | $42.8M |

**Breakeven for small team: ~$30-50M AUM**

### Growth-Stage Firm Breakeven (5-10 people)

**At this stage, fixed costs are $500K-$1M+:**
- Need $75M-$150M AUM just to break even
- Margin improvement comes from scale efficiencies
- This is the "valley of death" for many firms

## 11. Lifetime Value of a Client

### Client Retention Rates

| Firm Type | Annual Retention | Average Tenure |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Average firm | 90-92% | 10-12 years |
| Good firm | 95-96% | 20-25 years |

### Lifetime Value Calculation

**Formula**: LTV = (Annual Revenue × Gross Margin × Average Client Tenure)

**Example - $500K AUM client:**
- Annual revenue: $5,000
- Gross margin: 40%
- Average tenure: 20 years
- **LTV = $5,000 × 40% × 20 = $40,000**

### LTV by Client Tier

| Client AUM | Annual Revenue | LTV (20 years, 40% margin) |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| $250K | $2,500 | $20,000 |
| $500K | $5,000 | $40,000 |
| $1M | $10,000 | $80,000 |
| $2.5M | $20,000 | $160,000 |
| $5M | $32,500 | $260,000 |
| $10M | $50,000 | $400,000 |

### LTV:CAC Ratio

**Target**: LTV:CAC > 3:1

| Client AUM | LTV | Acceptable CAC | Max CAC |
|-----------|-----|----------------|---------|
| $250K | $20,000 | $6,667 | $10,000 |
| $500K | $40,000 | $13,333 | $20,000 |
