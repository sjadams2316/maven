# Fee Model Evolution in Wealth Management
*Deep Research | February 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

The financial advisory fee landscape is undergoing significant transformation. While AUM (Assets Under Management) remains the dominant pricing model—used by 86% of advisory firms as their primary method—alternative fee structures are gaining traction. This research explores current benchmarks, emerging models, fee compression dynamics, and strategic implications for advisory practices.

**Key Findings:**
- AUM fees remain dominant but are increasingly bundled with comprehensive planning services
- Subscription/retainer models are the fastest-growing alternative (85% of fee-for-service invoices)
- Fee compression hasn't materialized as predicted—margin compression has instead
- Direct indexing assets reached $864.3 billion in 2024, growing toward $1 trillion in 2026
- By 2026, 77.6% of the industry is expected to operate on fee-based models

## 1. AUM Fee Benchmarks by Client Tier

### Current AUM Fee Landscape

The traditional "1% AUM fee" is a simplified benchmark that obscures significant variation across portfolio sizes. According to 2024 Kitces Research and Inside Information's "Fees In Motion" report:

| Portfolio Size | Median AUM Fee | Fee Range (25th-75th percentile) |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Under $250K | 1.25%+ | 1.00% - 1.50% |
| $250K - $500K | 1.10% | 0.90% - 1.25% |
| $500K - $1M | 1.00% | 0.85% - 1.15% |
| $1M - $2M | 0.85% | 0.75% - 1.00% |
| $2M - $3M | 0.75% | 0.65% - 0.85% |
| $3M - $5M | 0.65% | 0.50% - 0.75% |
| $5M+ | 0.50% | 0.25% - 0.65% |
| $10M+ | 0.50% (avg 0.66% expected by 2026) | 0.25% - 0.50% |

**Critical Insight:** The blended AUM fee for high-net-worth clients is actually closer to 0.50% than 1%, contrary to popular perception.

### Fee Schedules by Structure Type

Three primary AUM fee structures exist:

1. **Graduated (58% of firms)** - Fees calculated as blended rates across tiers
   - Most common structure
   - Charges ~0.10%-0.15% less than cliff structures at comparable sizes
   - Provides flexibility for both smaller and larger clients

2. **Cliff (common among niche-focused firms)** - New rate applies retroactively to entire portfolio at each tier
   - Correlated with higher fee confidence
   - Associated with tighter client niche focus
   - Clients pay 10-15 bps more at lower and higher asset levels

3. **Flat** - Single rate applied regardless of portfolio size
   - Simpler but less common
   - Direct fee scaling creates perception challenges

### All-In Costs: The Complete Picture

Advisory fees alone don't capture total client costs. According to Veres/Inside Information research:

| Portfolio Size | Advisory Fee | All-In Cost (including expense ratios, platform fees) |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Under $250K | ~1.25% | 1.85% |
| $500K - $1M | 1.00% | 1.65% |
| $1M - $2M | 0.85% | 1.50% |
| $2M - $3M | 0.75% | 1.40% |
| $5M+ | 0.50% | 1.20% |

**Key Finding:** The underlying costs (trading fees, expense ratios, platform fees) remain remarkably consistent at 0.60%-0.70% across portfolio sizes.

### AUM Fee Allocation

How advisors allocate their AUM fees reveals the expanding scope of services:

- **Average allocation:** 59% to investment management, 41% to financial planning and other services
- **Bundled planning firms:** 54% investment management, 46% planning/other
- **Unbundled firms:** 73% investment management, 27% other

---

## 2. Flat Fee Models — Who's Doing It Successfully?

### Current Adoption

According to the 2024 Envestnet/MoneyGuide State of Financial Planning & Fees Study:

- **40% of advisors** charging financial planning fees use a fixed/flat fee model
- **Average flat fee:** $2,554 annually
- **Range:** $2,000 - $7,500 for standard planning; $7,500 - $55,000 for comprehensive

### Successful Flat Fee Characteristics

Firms succeeding with flat fees share common traits:

1. **Clear Service Definition** - Defined scope of work prevents scope creep
2. **Niche Focus** - Specialization allows predictable service delivery
3. **Process Standardization** - Efficient delivery systems reduce per-client cost
4. **Value Articulation** - Strong communication of what's included

### Flat Fee Advantages

**For Advisors:**
- Predictable revenue stream independent of market fluctuations
- Ability to serve clients without investable assets
- Clear scope of engagement
- No conflicts around growing portfolio vs. paying down debt

**For Clients:**
- Cost predictability
- Transparency
- No penalty for portfolio growth
- Alignment on comprehensive planning (not just investment growth)

### Flat Fee Challenges

- Difficulty scaling to very high-net-worth clients
- Annual renewal discussions can create client friction
- Requires strong value proposition to justify renewal
- May feel expensive to clients without significant planning complexity

### Notable Flat-Fee or Hybrid Practitioners

Many successful firms use flat fees as a component:
- **XYPN Network:** 1,800+ members required to offer monthly subscription/retainer
- **Garrett Planning Network:** Hourly/project-based fee-only planning
- **Numerous boutique RIAs:** Flat fee + reduced AUM hybrid models

## 3. Subscription/Retainer Models

### The Subscription Revolution

Subscription-based financial planning is the fastest-growing fee model. According to the 2025 AdvicePay Fee-for-Service Industry Trend Report:

- **85% of fee-for-service invoices** in 2024 were subscription-based (up from 83% in 2023)
- **Average monthly subscription fee:** $278 (up 5% from $265 in 2023)
- **Average annual retainer:** $4,484 (Envestnet/MoneyGuide 2024)

### Why Subscriptions Work

**Client Psychology:**
- Monthly billing aligns with how consumers budget
- Lower fee salience vs. large annual payments
- "Netflix model" feels familiar and manageable
- Encourages ongoing engagement (already paying, might as well use it)

**Business Benefits:**
1. **Recurring Revenue** - Predictable cash flow regardless of markets
2. **Client Retention** - Auto-billing creates default retention
3. **Scalability** - Can serve 150+ clients at $100-300/month efficiently
4. **Broader Market Access** - Serves Gen X/Y clients without large portfolios

### Subscription Pricing Benchmarks

| Service Level | Monthly Fee Range |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Basic Planning | $100 - $200 |
| Comprehensive Planning | $200 - $350 |
| Comprehensive + Investment Management | $300 - $500 |
| Premium/Complex Situations | $500 - $1,000+ |

### Implementation Best Practices (per XYPN)

1. **Create Service Calendars** - Map out monthly/quarterly touchpoints
2. **Automate Billing** - Use tools like AdvicePay for recurring collection
3. **Define Clear Deliverables** - Clients know what to expect each period
4. **Tier by Complexity** - Not just assets (e.g., physician in residency vs. established practice)
5. **Build Scalable Value** - Newsletters, webinars, group workshops

### Regulatory Considerations

Monthly subscription models face some unique regulatory challenges:
- State investment adviser registration requirements
- SEC/state custody rules for fee collection methods
- Compliance documentation for ongoing advice relationships

## 4. Fee Compression Trends

### The Fee Compression Narrative vs. Reality

**The Prediction:** Industry observers long predicted fee compression would force advisory fees down toward robo-advisor levels.

**The Reality:** According to Cerulli and industry research:

> "Fee compression hasn't played out, but margin compression is real."

### What's Actually Happening

1. **Headline fees remain stable** - Average fixed percentage fee: 1.05% (Envestnet 2024)
2. **Services have expanded dramatically** to justify fees:
   - Comprehensive financial planning (now bundled in AUM)
   - Tax planning and preparation
   - Estate planning coordination
   - Insurance reviews
   - Alternative investment access
   - Bill pay services

3. **Costs have increased:**
   - CFPs, CPAs, attorneys don't come cheap
   - Additional technology tools required
   - More staff for expanded services

### Margin Compression Data

Mark Tibergien's definition of scale: "Revenue growing faster than the firm's expenses."

**The Challenge:** Many firms have added services (maintaining revenue) but dramatically increased cost-to-serve, compressing profit margins.

### Fee Compression by Client Tier

Cerulli research indicates fee pressure is most acute at the high end:

| Client Tier | Current Avg Fee | Expected 2026 Fee |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| $100K assets | 125 bps | Stable |
| $500K assets | 100-110 bps | Stable |
| $5M+ assets | 70-75 bps | 66-70 bps |
| $10M+ assets | 65-70 bps | ~66 bps |

**Key Trend:** By 2026, 83% of advisors expect to charge less than 1% for clients with $5M+ in investable assets.

### Industry Shift to Fee-Based Models

Cerulli projects:
- **2024:** 72% of advisors use fee-based compensation
- **2026:** 77.6% expected on fee-based models
- **2026:** 54% of advisors will derive 90%+ of revenue from advisory fees (up from 44% in 2024)

### Strategies for Navigating Fee Pressure

1. **Differentiate through service breadth** - More services at same fee
2. **Technology leverage** - AI, automation to reduce cost-to-serve
3. **Niche specialization** - Command premium pricing in specific segments
4. **Alternative revenue streams** - Planning fees, tax prep, insurance
5. **Scale through efficiency** - Reduce per-client cost, not fees

## 5. Direct Indexing Economics

### Market Overview

Direct indexing has experienced explosive growth:

- **Year-end 2024 assets:** $864.3 billion (Cerulli)
- **Projected 2026:** $1+ trillion
- **Growth context:** Compared to $9.4T in index ETFs and $6.6T in index mutual funds

### Adoption Rates

Despite industry buzz, advisor adoption remains limited:
- **18% of advisors** report using direct indexing (2024, up from 16% in 2023)
- **26% choose not to use it** despite availability
- **12% don't know what it is**
- **50% of RIAs with $1B+ AUM** are offering or planning to offer direct indexing

### Direct Indexing Fee Structure

| Provider Type | Typical Fee Range |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Robo-advisors (e.g., Wealthfront) | 0.02% - 0.10% |
| TAMP-delivered | 0.15% - 0.35% |
| RIA-implemented | 0.25% - 0.50% |
| Traditional SMA managers | 0.35% - 0.50% |

**Note:** Direct indexing fees are typically additive to advisory fees, though some advisors bundle them.

### Value Proposition

**Tax Alpha Potential:**
- Morgan Stanley research: 0.3% - 1.0% annually from tax-loss harvesting
- Cache Exchange estimates: 1.5% - 3.5%+ from tax deferral strategies
- Value compounds significantly over time

**Customization Benefits:**
- ESG/values-based exclusions
- Concentrated stock management
- Sector tilts based on conviction

### Economic Considerations for Advisors

**Revenue Opportunity:**
- Direct indexing can justify additional fees or premium pricing
- Tax alpha creates demonstrable value story
- Appeals to high-net-worth, tax-sensitive clients

**Implementation Costs:**
- Technology platform requirements
- Increased operational complexity
- Wash-sale rule management
- Higher reporting/compliance burden

**Ideal Client Profile:**
- $500K+ in taxable accounts
- High marginal tax brackets
- Other assets generating capital gains
- Interest in customization/values alignment

### Challenges

1. **Tracking Error** - Gap between portfolio and benchmark
2. **Portfolio Ossification** - Over time, unrealized gains limit harvesting opportunities
3. **Complexity** - Rebalancing, dividends, loss harvesting require expertise
4. **Education Gap** - Most advisors and clients don't fully understand the strategy

## 6. Client Perception of Different Fee Models

### Understanding Client Psychology

**Fee Salience Matters**
The same total fee can feel different based on how it's presented:

| Fee Structure | Perceived Salience | Client Comfort |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| AUM (auto-deducted) | Low | High |
| Monthly subscription | Low-Medium | High |
| Annual retainer | Medium-High | Medium |
| Project/flat fee | High | Variable |
| Hourly | Very High | Low |

### What Clients Value

According to industry surveys and behavioral research:

1. **Transparency** - Understanding what they pay and for what
2. **Alignment** - Believing advisor interests match their own
3. **Simplicity** - Easy to understand and predict costs
4. **Value Demonstration** - Clear connection between fee and benefit

### Generational Differences

**Baby Boomers:**
- More comfortable with AUM model
- Expect comprehensive service for their fee
- Value relationship and trust

**Gen X:**
- Price-sensitive but value comprehensive planning
- Open to hybrid models
- Want clear value articulation

**Gen Y/Millennials:**
- Prefer subscription/Netflix-style models
- Expect transparent, easy-to-understand pricing
- More likely to seek fee-only advisors
- Values alignment matters (ESG, fiduciary)

### The Trust Factor

Consumer trust research indicates:
- Fee-only/fiduciary positioning builds higher trust
- Commission-based models generate skepticism
- Transparency about total costs increases satisfaction
- Regular communication justifies ongoing fees

### Common Client Objections by Fee Type

**AUM:**
- "Why should I pay more just because my portfolio grew?"
- "Am I subsidizing smaller clients?"
- "What happens in a down market?"

**Flat/Retainer:**
- "What if I don't use all the services?"
- "Why pay if the market is doing well on its own?"
- "Is this really worth $X per year?"

**Subscription:**
- "Do I need planning every month?"
- "Can I cancel anytime?"
- "What's the minimum commitment?"

### Best Practices for Fee Conversations

1. **Lead with value, not price** - Focus on outcomes and peace of mind
2. **Show total cost** - Include underlying fund costs for complete picture
3. **Benchmark appropriately** - Compare to alternatives (DIY, robo, etc.)
4. **Personalize the math** - Show dollar impact specific to their situation
5. **Emphasize comprehensive service** - Planning, tax, estate—not just investments

## 7. Strategic Implications & Recommendations

### For Advisory Practices Evaluating Fee Models

**Key Questions to Answer:**

1. **Who is your ideal client?**
   - Asset level, complexity, age/generation, planning needs
   
2. **What services do you provide?**
   - Investment-only vs. comprehensive wealth management
   
3. **What's your cost-to-serve?**
   - Can you profitably serve clients at target fee levels?
   
4. **What's your growth strategy?**
   - Serving more clients vs. higher-value clients

### Model Selection Framework

| If Your Practice... | Consider... |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Serves HNW clients with complex needs | Tiered AUM with comprehensive services |
| Targets mass affluent/emerging wealth | Subscription + AUM hybrid |
| Specializes in specific planning (e.g., young professionals) | Pure subscription/retainer |
| Offers investment management only | Competitive AUM or robo-style pricing |
| Wants to expand to younger demographics | Monthly subscription entry point |

### The Hybrid Future

Most successful firms are moving toward **multiple fee mechanisms:**
- **72% of advisory firms** use more than one charging method
- Combinations allow flexibility to serve diverse client needs
- Common: Base subscription + AUM for managed assets

### Technology as Enabler

Fee model evolution is enabled by technology:
- **Billing platforms:** AdvicePay, BillFin, Envestnet Payments
- **Planning software:** MoneyGuidePro, eMoney, RightCapital
- **Direct indexing:** Parametric, Aperio, various TAMP offerings
- **Automation:** Reduces cost-to-serve, enabling competitive pricing
