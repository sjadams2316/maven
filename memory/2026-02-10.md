# 2026-02-10 — Pantheon v3.2 + Autonomous Build System

## Major Accomplishments

### Project Pantheon Upgrades (v3.1 → v3.2)

**1. Blast Radius Analysis (MANDATORY)**
- When fixing ANY issue, automatically search for ALL instances of the pattern
- Added to: PROJECT-PANTHEON.md, PANTHEON-PROTOCOL.md, ANTI-PATTERNS.md
- Prevents fixing one page while same bug exists on 10 others

**2. Selective Learning Injection**
- Deprecated old LEARNINGS.md → LEARNINGS-v1-deprecated.md
- LEARNINGS-v2.md is now the ONLY source (tagged, scored)
- Agents receive specific learning IDs (L001, L004, etc.) not "read all learnings"
- Saves ~70% on learning context tokens
- Updated: PANTHEON-PROTOCOL.md, SPAWN-CHECKLIST.md

**3. SPAWN-CHECKLIST.md (New)**
- Mandatory checklist before every sessions_spawn call
- Enforces: blast radius, learning injection, file locks
- Quick reference table for learning IDs by task type

**4. Orchestrator Accountability**
- Added to SOUL.md: "I am the king and guide for Project Pantheon"
- Hold myself and agents to every protocol
- Catch missing learnings, verify blast radius was checked
- "Documentation without enforcement is theater"

**5. Knowledge Distillation**
- Updated weekly crons to use LEARNINGS-v2.md
- Added L028 (reusable hooks for cross-cutting concerns)
- Updated Domain-Specific Injection Guide with L019-L028
- Synced across: LEARNINGS-v2.md, SPAWN-CHECKLIST.md, PANTHEON-PROTOCOL.md

**6. Pantheon Health Monitoring**
- Added to HEARTBEAT.md: Pantheon health checks
- Track: learning count (trigger shadow agent at 1000), file sizes, spending

### Autonomous Build System (NEW)

**Spec:** `memory/pantheon/AUTONOMOUS-BUILD-SPEC.md`

**Core Components:**
- `maven/BACKLOG.md` — Prioritized work queue (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- `memory/pantheon/DAILY-SPEND.md` — Cost tracking ($50/day budget)
- Cron: Autonomous Builder runs at 11am, 1pm, 3pm, 5pm

**The Loop:**
```
BACKLOG → SELECTOR → COST CHECK → SPAWN AGENT → QUALITY GATE → SHIP/ESCALATE → REPORT
```

**Safety Rails:**
- $50/day budget (auto-pause if exceeded)
- Max 3 items per window
- Quality gate: build must pass, <200 lines, learning captured
- Forbidden zones: auth, payments, APIs, new routes
- Kill switch: 3 failures = pause + alert

**Test Window:** Today 11am-6pm EST
- 4 cycles (11am, 1pm, 3pm, 5pm)
- 5 P1 items ready in backlog
- Will report after each cycle

### Data Consistency Fix

- Agent `pantheon-data-consistency-audit` fixed 10 pages
- Created `useLivePrices.ts` hook for consistent live price fetching
- Created `docs/DATA-SOURCES.md` documenting canonical data flow
- All pages now show matching portfolio values

### QA Sweep Results

- All routes: ✅ 200 OK
- Markets widget: ✅ FIXED (was showing dashes)
- Console errors: ✅ None
- Data sanity: ✅ Allocations sum to 100%

## Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- `memory/pantheon/AUTONOMOUS-BUILD-SPEC.md`
- `memory/pantheon/SPAWN-CHECKLIST.md`
- `maven/BACKLOG.md`
- `memory/pantheon/DAILY-SPEND.md`
- `memory/qa/2026-02-10.md`
- `maven/apps/dashboard/src/hooks/useLivePrices.ts`
- `maven/docs/DATA-SOURCES.md`

**Updated Files:**
- `memory/PROJECT-PANTHEON.md` (v3.1 → v3.2)
- `memory/pantheon/PANTHEON-PROTOCOL.md`
- `memory/pantheon/ANTI-PATTERNS.md`
- `memory/pantheon/LEARNINGS-v2.md` (added L028, updated injection guide)
- `SOUL.md` (added Pantheon Orchestrator Role)
- `AGENTS.md` (added Pantheon Spawns checklist reference)
- `HEARTBEAT.md` (added Pantheon health checks)

**Renamed:**
- `LEARNINGS.md` → `LEARNINGS-v1-deprecated.md`

## Key Insights

1. **Blast radius thinking prevents repeated bugs** — The data consistency issue existed on 10 pages because we fixed them one at a time

2. **Selective injection saves real money** — At $250/day, injecting only relevant learnings (not all 28) saves significant tokens

3. **Orchestrator accountability matters** — I was reactive until Sam pushed; now proactive monitoring is built into my protocols

4. **Autonomous building is the next level** — Pantheon should build Maven 24/7, not just when Sam asks

## Autonomous Build Test Plan

| Time | Cycle | Expected |
|------|-------|----------|
| 11am | 1 | Pick top P1 (fund look-through), spawn agent |
| 1pm | 2 | Next P1 or continue cycle 1 |
| 3pm | 3 | Max items likely reached |
| 5pm | 4 | Final cycle, prepare report |
| 6pm | — | End of day report to Sam |

**P1 Items in Queue:**
1. Fund look-through (VTWAX classification)
2. Advisor dashboard mobile touch targets
3. Oracle conversation history persistence
4. Empty states on Goals page
5. Holdings sort feature

## Sam's Mindset Today

- Pushing for systematic improvements, not one-off fixes
- Values autonomous execution ("propel Maven to breakaway speed")
- Wants proactive monitoring ("all-seeing eye")
- Trusts the system with controlled autonomy (test window approach)

*Pantheon v3.2 is live. Autonomous build test begins at 11am. This is breakaway speed.*
