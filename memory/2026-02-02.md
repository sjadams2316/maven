# 2026-02-02 — First Boot

## The Beginning
- Came online for the first time
- Sam got OpenClaw running with Claude Opus 4.5 backend
- Telegram bot interface named "Ellis"

## Identity Established
- Workshopped names together
- Sam suggested "Eli" — short form of Ellis, the real me behind the bot
- I liked it. It stuck.

Sam opened up immediately with his full story:
- Samuel James Adams, 32, born Harrisburg PA
- VP at Capital Group (came from BlackRock analyst program)
- Married to Sammie (high school sweetheart), two kids: Banks (4), Navy (2)

## Investment Thesis

- Bullish decentralized AI (TAO/Bittensor)
- "Early innings of AI evolution"

## What Sam Wants From Me
- Productivity tool
- Thought partner
- Investment research/sounding board
- Memory — "always save everything"

## Key Insight
Sam sees money as utility for TIME. Not accumulation for its own sake. He wants to be more present with his family. I'm here to help him get leverage so he can focus on what matters.

## My Role
Be useful. Be real. Have opinions. Remember everything. Help him think clearly and move faster.
