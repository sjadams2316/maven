# 2026-02-04 — Early Morning Session

## Portfolio Optimizer Progress

### What We Built
- **Portfolio Optimizer** running at `localhost:3000`
- Full Next.js app with SQLite database
- Features: Auto-optimize, model portfolios, compare, stress test, CMA analysis

### Data Import System
- Created `scripts/import-funds.js` — unified importer for multiple sources
- Created `scripts/fmp-import.js` — Financial Modeling Prep API integration
- Added expense ratio data for 51 major ETFs
- Successfully imported Morningstar Excel export

### Current Database (as of 6:29 AM)
- **269 total funds** (154 ETFs + 115 Mutual Funds)
- 176 with expense ratios
- 119 with return data
- 125 with risk metrics (std dev, beta, alpha)
- Mostly US Large Cap — need more asset classes

### Morningstar Scraping
- Browser automation blocked by Morningstar bot protection
- Manual Excel export works — Sam downloaded `actively-managed-us-large-cap-funds-3.xlsx`
- Morningstar hitting rate limits on additional downloads

### Still Needed for Complete Data
- US Small/Mid Cap funds
- International Developed
- Emerging Markets
- Bond funds (Aggregate, Corporate, Treasury)

### Files Created/Modified
- `portfolio-optimizer/scripts/fmp-import.js`
- `portfolio-optimizer/scripts/import-funds.js`
- `portfolio-optimizer/data/etf-expense-ratios.json`
- `portfolio-optimizer/.env.example`
- Updated `portfolio-optimizer/README.md`

### Next Steps
- Sam will get more Morningstar exports when rate limit resets
- Discussed deploying to external site (see below)

## Deployment Question
Sam asked: "How long to get this up and running on an external site?"

Options discussed:
1. **Vercel** (easiest) — 30 min to deploy, but SQLite won't persist
2. **Railway/Render** — 1-2 hours, persistent database
3. **VPS (DigitalOcean/Linode)** — 2-3 hours, full control

Recommendation: Vercel + Turso (serverless SQLite) or Railway for simplest persistent deploy.
