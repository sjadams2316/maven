# QA Log — 2026-02-11

## Heartbeat 6:46 PM ET

### Data Health Check
- **Initial Status:** `degraded` — 45 minutes stale
- **Root Cause:** Two bugs found
  1. `Date.now() === Date.now()` condition never true (cache never updated)
  2. Legacy ETF symbols (SPY, QQQ, etc.) had old timestamps in cache
- **Fix Deployed:** Commits `fb49519` and `7f9dd42`
- **Final Status:** `healthy` — 0 seconds age

### Wednesday QA Flow: Partners → Client → Oracle
- **Partners Dashboard:** ✅ Loaded with AUM stats, client list, action items
- **Client Page (Robert Chen):** ✅ Holdings, performance, research activity visible
- **Oracle Chat:** ✅ Responded with intelligent, contextual advice

**Question Asked:** "Given Robert's AAPL and MSFT positions make up 22.5% of his portfolio as individual stocks, what specific risks should I discuss with him in our upcoming meeting?"

**Oracle Response Quality:** ✅ Excellent
- Correctly identified concentration risk
- Referenced actual portfolio data (AAPL +30.2% gain, VXUS -$3,000 loss)
- Provided 4 specific action items for meeting
- Suggested tax-efficient rebalancing strategy
- Recommended 5-10% cap on individual positions

### Bugs Fixed This Heartbeat
1. **L019:** Cache never updated due to impossible Date.now() equality check
2. **L020:** Health check tracking stale legacy symbols
