### Bugs Found

#### Oracle Demo Mode Bug (P1)
**Symptom:** Oracle shows $0 net worth, 0 accounts, 0 holdings even when accessing from /demo page.

**Impact:** Users in demo mode can't use Oracle effectively.

**Root Cause Investigation:**
- Fix commits exist (ab23b43, 5528719)
- `enterDemoMode()` from context IS being called on /demo page
- UserProvider's `loadProfile()` checks `isDemoModeEnabled()` first
- Yet Oracle still shows $0

**Hypothesis:** Chat history cached in localStorage. Old conversation persists showing $0 from before demo mode was enabled.

**Next Steps:**
1. Clear Oracle chat history on demo mode entry
2. OR: Add "New Chat" button to Oracle
3. OR: Check if MavenChat is checking isDemoMode correctly

### Build Issues

- GitHub Actions shows "failure" for recent commits
- Vercel deploys successfully (separate from GH Actions)
- Fixed build issue: Added `explore` to SECTION_PATH_MAP in useClientPortalSettings.ts (c3a1680)

### Commits Today
- `c3a1680` - fix: Add explore to SECTION_PATH_MAP in useClientPortalSettings hook
- `6849c7a` - feat: Enhanced client portal + advisor research visibility
- `c32f3d7` - feat: Explore Investments page

- Current Price: ~$269.48 (down ~2% recently)
- Analyst Consensus: "Buy" rating with $298.75 target (+9.35% upside)

**Fix:** Created `messages/page.tsx` with contact page content
**Commit:** `68e4585`
