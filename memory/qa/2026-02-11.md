### Bugs Found

#### Oracle Demo Mode Bug (P1)
**Symptom:** Oracle shows $0 net worth, 0 accounts, 0 holdings even when accessing from /demo page.

**Impact:** Users in demo mode can't use Oracle effectively.

**Root Cause Investigation:**
- Fix commits exist (ab23b43, 5528719)
- `enterDemoMode()` from context IS being called on /demo page
- UserProvider's `loadProfile()` checks `isDemoModeEnabled()` first
- Yet Oracle still shows $0

**Hypothesis:** Chat history cached in localStorage. Old conversation persists showing $0 from before demo mode was enabled.

**Next Steps:**
1. Clear Oracle chat history on demo mode entry
2. OR: Add "New Chat" button to Oracle
3. OR: Check if MavenChat is checking isDemoMode correctly

### Build Issues

- GitHub Actions shows "failure" for recent commits
- Vercel deploys successfully (separate from GH Actions)
- Fixed build issue: Added `explore` to SECTION_PATH_MAP in useClientPortalSettings.ts (c3a1680)

### Commits Today
- `c3a1680` - fix: Add explore to SECTION_PATH_MAP in useClientPortalSettings hook
- `6849c7a` - feat: Enhanced client portal + advisor research visibility
- `c32f3d7` - feat: Explore Investments page

### Test Flow: Partners → Client → Oracle → Verify Intelligent Response

| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Client Portal Home | ✅ | $850K portfolio, YTD +8.2% |
| Navigation Links | ✅ | All visible, correct paths |
| Explore Page | ✅ | Working |
| Search AAPL | ✅ | Autocomplete shows stocks, ETFs, options |

| **Oracle Chat** | ✅ | **Intelligent response verified** |
| Messages Page | ⚠️→✅ | **Fixed 404 bug** |

### Oracle Response Quality
Asked: "Tell me about AAPL and whether it would be a good fit for my portfolio"

Response included:
- Current Price: ~$269.48 (down ~2% recently)
- Analyst Consensus: "Buy" rating with $298.75 target (+9.35% upside)
- Investment Characteristics section
- Pros for Portfolio Inclusion analysis

**Verdict:** Oracle working with intelligent, contextual financial analysis ✅

### Bug Fixed: Messages 404
**Symptom:** `/c/DEMO-JS123/messages` returned 404
**Root Cause:** Nav pointed to `/messages` but page didn't exist (only `/contact`)
**Fix:** Created `messages/page.tsx` with contact page content
**Commit:** `68e4585`

### Summary
