# QA Log — 2026-02-10

## 20:59 EST — Tuesday Rotation: Partners → Client → Oracle

**Test:** Ask unique tax question, verify intelligent response

**Flow:**
1. ✅ Partners Dashboard (`?demo=true`) — loaded, all stats showing
2. ✅ Client Detail (Robert Chen) — AUM $1.25M, tools available
3. ✅ Oracle Chat — asked: "If Robert sold all his AAPL position today, what would be the approximate capital gains tax impact given his 32% federal bracket?"

**Oracle Response (verified contextual):**
- Referenced actual AAPL position: $62,500 value, $14,500 unrealized gains
- Applied correct 20% LTCG rate (for 32% federal bracket)
- Calculated: $2,900 federal tax, $11,600 net after-tax gain
- Explained NIIT threshold, state tax considerations
- Offered to check tax-loss harvesting opportunities

**Result:** ✅ PASS — Real Claude with client context, not hardcoded

## Earlier: Sam asked about Project Pantheon completeness

**Finding:** v4.0 diagram focused narrowly on QA/execution, stripped out the full organizational hierarchy from the original vision.

**Full hierarchy should include:**
- Tool Teams (Portfolio Lab, Tax, Retirement, etc.) — each with Lead, UX, Research, Data, Dev, QA
- Persona Specialists (Tech Exec, Inheritor, Pre-Retiree, Business Owner)
- Cross-Cutting Teams (Integration, Compliance, Growth, Infra, Red Team)
- Validation Layer (Quality, Outcome, Compliance validators)
- Meta Teams (Competitive Intel, Self-Improvement, Memory Consolidation)

**Status:** Documented in `PROJECT-PANTHEON.md`, but not actively running as described. Sam wants true multi-agent hierarchy built out.
