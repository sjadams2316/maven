# 2026-02-08 Session Notes

## GitHub Setup
- Connected workspace to GitHub: https://github.com/sjadams2316/maven
- Created Personal Access Token with repo scope
- Cleaned up node_modules and API keys from git history
- Configured git identity as "Sam Adams"

## UI Polish
- **Glowing Oracle Ball**: Added breathing/pulsing animation to floating chat button
  - 3-second animation cycle
  - Purple glow radiates outward (box-shadow layers)
  - Subtle scale pulse (1.0 → 1.05)
  - Changed icon to 🔮 crystal ball

- **Reorganized Dashboard Tools**:
  - **Primary Tools** (5 visible): Oracle, Portfolio Lab, Fragility Index, Tax-Loss Harvester, Financial Snapshot
  - **Additional Tools** (collapsible, 8 more): Social Security, Retirement Optimizer, What-If Scenarios, Roth Converter, Rebalancing, Risk Analysis, Link Accounts, Collaborative Planning
  - Market Fragility Index promoted to Primary per Sam's feedback

## Business Strategy: Maven Tiering
Created `maven/docs/TIERING.md` defining three tiers:

1. **Maven Basic** (Free)
   - Top of funnel, lead gen
   - Limited features, manual entry only
   
2. **Maven Pro** ($29-49/month)
   - DIY investors who want tools
   - Full features, Plaid linking
   - Conversion funnel to Partners
   
3. **Maven Partners** (Included in AUM)
   - **This is the business** — RIA clients
   - Schwab direct link, advisor curation
   - White-glove onboarding with welcome card
   - "You see everything, they see what you want"

Key innovation: **Advisor-controlled UX** — advisors can curate which insights clients see (show/hide/contextualize). Solves the "client sees scary risk" problem.

Morgan Stanley / E*Trade comp: Pro users are a prospecting funnel that converts to Partners when life events happen.

## Advisor Dashboard (MAJOR BUILD)

### Pages Created:
1. **`/advisor`** - Advisor home

4. **`/advisor/clients/[id]/prep`** - Meeting prep
5. **`/advisor/insights`** - Global insights view
6. **`/advisor/settings`** - Firm settings
7. **`/advisor/analytics`** - Practice analytics
8. **`/advisor/clients/invite`** - Client invite flow

## Evening Build Session - Monte Carlo Deep Upgrade

Sam asked me to make the Monte Carlo "the most accurate tool out there" with continuous upgrades. Built a production-grade system:

### Historical Data Layer (`/lib/historical-returns.ts`)
- 97 years of S&P 500 annual returns (1928-2024)
- 10-Year Treasury Bond returns (1928-2024)
- International (EAFE) returns (1970-2024)
- Gold returns (1972-2024)
- REIT returns (1972-2024)
- Bitcoin returns (2011-2024)
- CPI inflation rates (1928-2024)
- **Correlation matrix** between all asset classes
- Historical drawdown periods

### Monte Carlo Engine (`/lib/monte-carlo-engine.ts`)
- **Bootstrap sampling** from actual historical returns (not random normal)
- **Fat-tailed distributions** using Student's t-distribution for crash scenarios
- **Correlation-aware** multi-asset simulation
- Multiple withdrawal strategies (fixed, flexible, guardrails)
- Glide path allocation adjustment over time
- Social Security integration
- Basic tax modeling (RMD, qualified vs non-qualified)
- 1,000+ simulation runs per analysis

### Stress Test System (`/lib/stress-test-scenarios.ts`)
Historical crisis scenarios with actual asset class returns:
- Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009)
- COVID-19 Crash (2020)
- Dot-Com Crash (2000-2002)
- 2022 Bear Market
- Black Monday 1987
- 1973-74 Oil Crisis
- Euro Debt Crisis (2011)
- 1994 Rising Rates

### Safe Withdrawal Rate Calculator (`/lib/safe-withdrawal.ts`)
- Historical SWR analysis across all 97 years
- Multiple withdrawal strategies (Fixed, Guardrails, RMD-style, Floor/Ceiling)
- **Sequence of returns risk** visualization
- Worst/best case historical periods identification

### Valuation Indicators (`/lib/valuation-indicators.ts`)
- CAPE ratio historical data and projections
- Buffett Indicator (Market Cap to GDP)
- Fed Model (earnings yield vs treasury)
- Expected return estimation from valuations
- Market outlook generator

### New Pages:
- `/stress-test` — Historical crisis impact analysis
- `/safe-withdrawal` — SWR calculator with sequence risk
- `/monte-carlo` — Upgraded with real historical data

### API Endpoints:
- `/api/historical-returns` — Fetches live data from FRED
- `/api/monte-carlo` — Runs simulations server-side
- `/api/valuations` — Current market valuation indicators

### Commits:
- `1b17978` - Major Monte Carlo upgrade (historical bootstrap, fat tails, correlation, stress testing)
- `35e8b36` - Safe Withdrawal Rate calculator with sequence risk

### Still TODO:
- Integrate valuation data into Monte Carlo expected returns
- Market Outlook page using valuation indicators
- Real-time data refresh for historical returns
- Sensitivity analysis visualization

## Bug Fixes

### Oracle Claude Integration
- **Issue:** Oracle sometimes falls back to generic responses
- **Root cause:** Missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
- **Fix:** Added placeholder in .env.local, updated fallback to clearly indicate when in fallback mode, updated UI to say "Powered by Claude"
- **Action needed:** Sam needs to add his Anthropic API key to `maven/apps/dashboard/.env.local`

### Bitcoin Price
- **Issue:** Sam thought BTC price was incorrect/hardcoded
- **Reality:** BTC price IS live from Polygon API — $69,289 is the actual current price
- Data sources confirmed working: Yahoo (indices), Polygon/CoinGecko (crypto)

## Git Commits Today
- Initial morning commits (from previous session)
- "Add 12 new pages: compliance, risk questionnaire, performance attribution, rebalance, benchmarks, trade center, asset location, monte carlo, income planner, alerts + settings, reports"

## Total Pages Built: 36+ pages
## Total Lines of Code: ~15,000+

🚀🚀🚀 Massive build weekend

## Afternoon Session (2:00 PM - 2:40 PM)

### Landing Page Fix
- Removed auto-redirect for signed-in users
- Users now always see landing page first, can choose to go to dashboard

### Dashboard Reorganization
- **Retirement Hub → Primary Tool** (replaced Tax-Loss Harvester)
- **Advisor Dashboard Hidden** from client view (access via direct URL only)
- Advisor separation discussion: future subdomain `advisor.mavenwealth.ai`

### Monte Carlo Improvements
- Added "🎯 At Retirement (Age X)" milestone card showing:
  - Portfolio balance at retirement age
  - Social Security income + start age
  - Target spending (annual + monthly)
  - Initial withdrawal rate (color-coded)
  - Link to Social Security Optimizer

### "How Does This Work?" (ToolExplainer)
Built reusable component with educational explanations for 13 tools:
- Modal shows: Summary, Methodology, Data Sources, Limitations
- Added to: Monte Carlo, Fragility Index, Social Security, Tax-Loss Harvesting, Oracle, Portfolio Lab, Safe Withdrawal, Stress Test, Market Outlook, Sensitivity, Asset Location, Income Planner, Retirement Optimizer

### Oracle Unification
- Fixed: MavenChat now dynamically checks if Claude is enabled
- Shows "Powered by Claude" (green) or "⚠️ Limited Mode" (amber)
- Verified: Claude IS enabled in production (`claudeEnabled: true`)

### Persistent Memory System
Created memory system for Oracle to learn from conversations:
- New API: `/api/oracle/memory`
- Extracts: preferences, goals, concerns, risk tolerance, family info
- Memories included in Claude's system prompt
- Prisma schema: `OracleMemory` model added

### "EZ Button" Pattern (OracleShowcase)
Built `OracleShowcase` component — one-click AI explanations with:
- 4 tabs: Overview, Compare, Stress Test, Projections
- Animated charts and visualizations
- Claude-powered personalized analysis
- Gamified action items

Added to tools:
1. **Portfolio Lab** → "Have Maven Oracle Explain These Changes"
2. **Monte Carlo** → "Have Maven Oracle Explain My Retirement Outlook"
3. **Tax-Loss Harvesting** → "Have Maven Oracle Walk Me Through This"
4. **Fragility Index** → "Have Maven Oracle Explain What This Means"
5. **Social Security** → "Have Maven Oracle Compare My Claiming Options"

### Sam's Question: Am I Learning?
Honest answer:
- ✅ I read MEMORY.md each session (curated knowledge)
- ✅ I update daily notes
- ✅ Oracle now has persistent memory (within sessions)
- ❌ Not yet: Pattern recognition across sessions
- ❌ Not yet: Proactive suggestions without prompting
- 💡 Idea: Create `PROACTIVE.md` to track patterns + improvement ideas

### Deployment
- 95 routes live at https://mavenwealth.ai
- New: `/api/oracle/memory` endpoint

## Running Deployment
Build in progress as of 2:40 PM...
