# 2026-02-08 (Evening Session)

## Major Accomplishments

### Data Consistency Overhaul
- Created `maven/apps/dashboard/src/lib/portfolio-utils.ts` — centralized functions to derive portfolio allocation from actual holdings
- Fixed 7 pages that had hardcoded data instead of using `useUserProfile()`:
  - `/stress-test` — now derives allocation from holdings
  - `/monte-carlo` — now derives allocation from holdings
  - `/rebalance` — now uses `financials.allHoldings`
  - `/income` — now derives from dividend holdings + SS data
  - `/asset-location` — now uses actual accounts/holdings
  - `/retirement` — now calculates age from `profile.dateOfBirth`
- Created `maven/docs/DATA-CONSISTENCY-AUDIT.md` documenting all fixes

### Mobile Responsiveness Sweep
- Fixed 27+ pages with mobile layout issues
- Key pattern changes:
  - `grid-cols-4` → `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4`
  - `grid-cols-12` sidebar layouts → `grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-12`
  - `col-span-4/8` → `col-span-1 lg:col-span-4/8`
  - `p-8` → `p-4 md:p-8`
  - Added `overflow-x-auto` to tables

### Icon Audit
- Fixed confusing valuation icons in `/investment-thesis`:
  - cheap: `💚` → `✅`
  - fair: `💛` → `➖`
  - expensive: `❤️` → `⚠️` (heart was confusing for "expensive")

### Voice Input Debugging
- Added extensive logging to MavenChat voice recording
- Added support for multiple audio formats (webm, mp4, ogg, wav)
- Better error messages for permission/device errors
- Still investigating — Sam reports it's not picking up his voice

### Proactivity Framework Established
Sam asked how I can be more proactive. Agreed on 3 approaches:
1. **"Sweep" command** — I do full QA audit when asked
2. **Spawn QA agents** — Parallel background audits
3. **Weekly QA day** — Dedicated session for finding issues

Created:
- `maven/QA-CHECKLIST.md` — Concrete testing steps
- Updated `HEARTBEAT.md` — Actual tasks for periodic check-ins

### QA Sweep Results
Spawned 2 parallel QA agents:
1. **qa-navigation** found:
   - 3 broken links (fixed: `/tax-loss` → `/tax-harvesting`, `/contact` → `/help`, `/advisor/notifications` → `/advisor`)
   - 7 placeholder `href="#"` links
   - 28 pages missing "← Back to Dashboard" links

2. **qa-data-consistency** found:
   - All 12 major pages correctly use `useUserProfile()` ✅
   - 2 hardcoded "$732k" should be "$800k" (fixed)

## Key Learnings

### DEMO_PROFILE Actual Net Worth
The demo profile calculates to **~$800k** (not $732k as previously stated):
- Total Assets: ~$1,255,000
- Total Liabilities: ~$457,500
- Net Worth: ~$797,500

### Feature Suggestions (for future)
High-impact ideas I proposed:
1. Spending Tracker / Budget View
2. Historical Net Worth Chart (store weekly snapshots)
3. Personalized Alerts Dashboard
4. Goal Progress Visualization (Duolingo-style)
5. Quick Actions from Oracle ("Rebalance my portfolio" → opens tool)
6. Dark/Light Mode Toggle
7. Onboarding Checklist
8. Export/Print Reports

## Files Modified
- 27+ page files for mobile responsiveness
- `src/lib/portfolio-utils.ts` (new)
- `src/app/components/MavenChat.tsx` (voice debugging)
- `src/app/investment-thesis/page.tsx` (icon fix)
- `maven/QA-CHECKLIST.md` (new)
- `HEARTBEAT.md` (updated with actual tasks)
- `maven/docs/DATA-CONSISTENCY-AUDIT.md` (new)

## Sam's Feedback
- Wants me to be more proactive about finding issues
- Appreciates creativity, wants more feature suggestions
- Voice input still not working for him (needs more debugging)
- Mobile formatting was not great — now fixed

## Late Evening Session (17:34 EST)

### Maven Smoke Test
- Site confirmed live at https://mavenwealth.ai (all pages 200 OK)
- API endpoints healthy:
  - `/api/chat` - 200
  - `/api/fragility-index` - 200
  - `/api/market-data` - live data (S&P 6932, BTC $70,885, TAO $163.99)

### Mobile Responsiveness Audit (Completed)
- Reviewed 76 total pages
- Most already had proper responsive patterns
- Key files verified:
  - `/home`, `/goals`, `/learn`, `/refer` — good patterns
  - `/advisor/*` pages — good patterns  
  - `/trade`, `/integrations`, `/estate` — good patterns
  - `/financial-snapshot` — already responsive
  - `/fragility` — already responsive

### Sensitivity Page Fix
- Improved `/sensitivity` to use actual portfolio data
- Now imports `calculateAllocationFromFinancials` from portfolio-utils
- Added useEffect to populate params from UserProvider data
- Improved simulation formula (calibrated to Trinity Study)
- Added "Using your portfolio data" indicator when loaded

### Documentation Updated
- `maven/docs/DATA-CONSISTENCY-AUDIT.md` — marked sensitivity as improved
- Updated status table with completion dates

### No TypeScript Errors
- Build verified clean

## Late Evening Session #2 (18:00-18:15 EST)

### Sam's Feedback: First Impression Problem
Sam pointed out that clicking "Try Demo" showed a scary concentration warning as the first thing users see. He wanted it to lead with VALUE (money found) not warnings.

He also asked about a Morgan Freeman GIF holding the Oracle sphere — I explained the legal/ethical issues with using celebrity likeness and offered alternatives.

### The Three Modal Discovery
Found that there were THREE different intro modals, and I was updating the wrong ones:

| File | Triggers From | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| `FirstWinModal.tsx` | "Try Demo" on landing page | **THE ONE SAM WAS SEEING** |
| Portfolio Optimizer intro | `/portfolio-optimizer` direct visit | Separate modal |
| `OracleWelcome.tsx` | "Enter Maven" on landing | New cinematic welcome |

### Fixes Applied

1. **FirstWinModal.tsx** (the main fix):
   - BEFORE: "⚠️ Maven Found Something - 42% Tech Concentration"
   - AFTER: "💰 We found $4,185" with breakdown:
     - $3,700 tax savings (ARKK loss harvesting)
     - $485/year fee reduction (QQQ→QQQM)
     - 3 insights need attention
   - Green/teal money theme
   - CTA: "Show Me Everything"

2. **Portfolio Optimizer intro modal**:
   - BEFORE: Feature grid (X-Ray, Factors, Stress Test, Tax Alpha)
   - AFTER: Money hook ($4,185 found) with value breakdown

3. **Demo tour reordered** (ENHANCED_DEMO_TOUR):
   - ACT 1: Tax savings hook ($3,700)
   - ACT 2: Fee savings ($485/year)
   - ACT 3: X-Ray vision (superpower framing)
   - ACT 4: Intelligence showcase
   - ACT 5: Deeper analysis
   - ACT 6: Protection (stress tests last, not first)

4. **Created OracleWelcome.tsx**:
   - Cinematic 5-stage text reveal
   - "Your money has been waiting / For someone who understands / Maven does."
   - Glowing orb with particles
   - Session-aware (only shows once)

### Commits
- `5588a58` - Epic welcome experience + reordered demo tour
- `0b29654` - Fix demo intro modal (portfolio optimizer)
- `193e3a3` - Fix FirstWinModal (THE ACTUAL FIX)

### Key Learning
When debugging UI issues, trace the EXACT user flow:
1. What button are they clicking?
2. What component handles that click?
3. What modal/view does that trigger?

Don't assume — follow the code path.

### New Files Created
- `src/app/components/OracleWelcome.tsx` — Epic welcome experience
- `docs/ORACLE-WELCOME-ANIMATIONS.md` — Lottie animation guide
