# 2026-02-08 Session Notes

## GitHub Setup
- Connected workspace to GitHub: https://github.com/sjadams2316/maven
- Created Personal Access Token with repo scope
- Cleaned up node_modules and API keys from git history
- Configured git identity as "Sam Adams"

## UI Polish
- **Glowing Oracle Ball**: Added breathing/pulsing animation to floating chat button
  - 3-second animation cycle
  - Purple glow radiates outward (box-shadow layers)
  - Subtle scale pulse (1.0 → 1.05)
  - Changed icon to 🔮 crystal ball

- **Reorganized Dashboard Tools**:
  - **Primary Tools** (5 visible): Oracle, Portfolio Lab, Fragility Index, Tax-Loss Harvester, Financial Snapshot
  - **Additional Tools** (collapsible, 8 more): Social Security, Retirement Optimizer, What-If Scenarios, Roth Converter, Rebalancing, Risk Analysis, Link Accounts, Collaborative Planning
  - Market Fragility Index promoted to Primary per Sam's feedback

## Business Strategy: Maven Tiering
Created `maven/docs/TIERING.md` defining three tiers:

1. **Maven Basic** (Free)
   - Top of funnel, lead gen
   - Limited features, manual entry only
   
2. **Maven Pro** ($29-49/month)
   - DIY investors who want tools
   - Full features, Plaid linking
   - Conversion funnel to Partners
   
3. **Maven Partners** (Included in AUM)
   - **This is the business** — RIA clients
   - Schwab direct link, advisor curation
   - White-glove onboarding with welcome card
   - "You see everything, they see what you want"

Key innovation: **Advisor-controlled UX** — advisors can curate which insights clients see (show/hide/contextualize). Solves the "client sees scary risk" problem.

Morgan Stanley / E*Trade comp: Pro users are a prospecting funnel that converts to Partners when life events happen.

## Advisor Dashboard (MAJOR BUILD)
Built complete advisor control plane at `/advisor`:

### Pages Created:
1. **`/advisor`** - Advisor home
   - Stats: Total AUM, active clients, alerts
   - Upcoming meetings with quick prep links
   - Insights requiring attention
   - Recent client activity feed
   - Quick actions

2. **`/advisor/clients`** - Client list
   - Search, filter (all/needs attention/inactive), sort
   - Shows AUM, last login, alerts, tone setting
   - Click-through to detail

3. **`/advisor/clients/[id]`** - Client detail
   - 5 tabs: Portfolio, Insights, Activity, Notes, Settings
   - **Portfolio**: Allocation chart, accounts, holdings table with gains
   - **Insights**: Per-insight curation controls (visibility dropdown + advisor notes)
   - **Activity**: Login/page view history
   - **Notes**: Free-form advisor notes
   - **Settings**: Client tone (conservative/moderate/engaged)

4. **`/advisor/clients/[id]/prep`** - Meeting prep
   - Portfolio summary with changes since last meeting
   - Auto-generated talking points by priority
   - Action items checklist (with completion toggle)
   - Suggested agenda with timing
   - Generate PDF / Email to client buttons

5. **`/advisor/insights`** - Global insights view
   - All insights across all clients
   - Filter by severity, type, search
   - Shows potential savings rollup

### Key Features:
- Insight curation: show / show_with_context / advisor_only / discussion
- Client tone settings control Maven's proactive behavior
- Advisor notes on insights persist

- Activity tracking shows what clients viewed

### Navigation:
