# Sam's Strategic Decisions

*Living record of key decisions and the reasoning behind them.*

---

## Business Strategy

### Maven is RIA-First (2026-02-05)
**Decision:** Build our own RIA first, not SaaS for other advisors.
**Reasoning:** 
- Eat our own cooking
- Keep best tech in-house
- Word of mouth > paid acquisition
- "Clients don't want service. They want an experience."

### Jon is the Tip of the Spear (2026-02-09)
**Decision:** Jon does the breakaway first. Sam joins when traction is proven.
**Reasoning:**
- Sam has $720K job, family to support
- Jon has existing client relationships
- Validates before Sam takes income hit
- Reduces family risk

### Two Products, One Platform (2026-02-05)
**Decision:** Maven Pro (for RIAs) + Maven Personal (direct to consumer)
**Reasoning:**
- RIA validates with sophisticated users
- Consumer is larger market long-term
- Same core intelligence powers both

## Product Decisions

### Lead with Value, Not Warnings (2026-02-08)
**Decision:** First thing users see is money found, not risk alerts.
**Reasoning:**
- Demo was showing scary concentration warning first
- "💰 We found $4,185" hooks better than "⚠️ 42% Tech"
- Warnings come later, after trust is built

### Dashboard = Clean Cards + Insights (2026-02-09)
**Decision:** Dashboard should look like /demo page — simple, card-based, actionable.
**Reasoning:**
- Old dashboard was cluttered
- Users want clarity, not complexity
- Insights drive engagement
**LOCKED:** This layout is now canonical. Do not change without Sam's approval.
- Net Worth card (top)
- Insights for You (dynamic, based on portfolio)
- Portfolio Allocation (visual bar)
- Top Holdings (with gain/loss %)
- Quick Actions (sidebar)
- Markets (sidebar)
- Goals (sidebar)
- Oracle CTA (sidebar)
- Explore Maven (bottom)

### Explain the WHY (2026-02-07)
**Decision:** Every recommendation includes reasoning.
**Reasoning:**
- Generic advice doesn't build trust
- "Here's what to do AND here's why"
- Differentiator vs. robos

## Technical Decisions

### Project Pantheon - Multi-Agent Architecture (2026-02-09)
**Decision:** Build Maven with specialized agent teams working in parallel.
**Reasoning:**
- Exponential growth through parallelization
- Specialization creates depth
- Compound learning 24/7
- Sam can't direct everything manually

### AI-Native, Not AI-Assisted (2026-02-05)
**Decision:** Maven IS the intelligence, not a dashboard with AI features.
**Reasoning:**
- Legacy players are bolting on AI
- We're building from first principles
- This is the moat

## Financial Decisions

### Target Data Providers
- **Morningstar:** $25-50K/year — target for Q2 2026
- **Plaid:** ~$500/mo — next priority for account aggregation
- **Current:** FMP, Polygon, Yahoo, CoinGecko (all free tier)
