# 2026-02-09 — Daily Notes

## Research Session (6:00 AM — Cron Job)

### Domain Research Completed

**1. Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZ)**
- Deep dive on OBBBA 2025 updates — program is now permanent
- Key insight: December 31, 2026 deadline for pre-2027 investments
- Rural QOZs get 30% basis step-up (vs 10% standard)
- New reporting requirements with stiff penalties ($10K-$250K)
- File: `memory/research/concentrated-positions/qualified-opportunity-zones.md`

**2. Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRT)**
- CRAT vs CRUT mechanics, all variations (NICRUT, NIMCRUT, Flip-CRUT)
- Four-tier "worst-in-first-out" taxation
- §7520 rate sensitivity — current high rates favor CRATs
- SECURE 2.0 one-time QCD-to-CRT option ($54K, 2025)
- File: `memory/research/estate-planning/charitable-remainder-trusts.md`

**3. Rule 144 & Restricted Stock**
- Affiliate vs non-affiliate rules
- Holding periods, tacking, volume limitations
- 10b5-1 plans with 2022 amendments (90-day cooling-off)
- Section 16 short-swing rules, blackout periods
- File: `memory/research/concentrated-positions/restricted-stock-rule-144.md`

### Product Innovation Research

**Wealthtech Trends 2026**
- Oliver Wyman's "10 Wealth Management Trends" analysis
- "Last-mile human" concept — AI does 90%, humans handle moments that matter
- Unified "client brain" as competitive moat
- Private markets going mainstream
- Downturn readiness as underserved differentiator
- File: `memory/research/product/2026-02-09-wealthtech-trends.md`

### Key Takeaways for Maven

1. **QOZ Module potential** — Help clients with capital gains understand QOZ vs alternatives
2. **CRT in Concentrated Position Lab** — Compare to VPF, exchange funds, direct indexing
3. **Restricted Stock Module** — For exec clients, track Rule 144/10b5-1 constraints
4. **Crisis Playbooks** — Build out Market Fragility Index into full downturn readiness

### RESEARCH-AGENDA.md Updated

Marked complete:
- QOZ (Track 3.1)
- CRT (Track 3.1 — Charitable strategies)
- Rule 144, 10b5-1, blackouts, Section 16 (Track 3.2 — entire section)

Added session log entry for 2026-02-09.

## Morning Session with Sam (6:30 AM - 7:00 AM)

### Strategic Discussion: Maven's Path to Dominance

Sam asked: "Can Maven become the operating intelligence layer in wealth management?"

**Key insight:** The window is open because:
- Legacy players are bolting on AI (not AI-native)
- No one has built the true "operating layer" yet
- Morningstar exiting creates opportunity
- Maven's compound learning is the moat

### Memory Problem Identified

Sam noticed I forgot "Project Pantheon" from a previous conversation. Real problem:
- Discussions happen but don't get documented
- Next session, context is lost
- Progress gets lost

**New commitment:** Document discussions immediately, not just builds.

### Dashboard Redesign

Sam showed me `/demo` page — clean card-based layout he wanted for main dashboard.

**Implemented:**
- Clean layout matching /demo
- Dynamic insights based on actual portfolio:
  - Tax-loss harvest opportunities (calculates from holdings with losses)
  - Concentration alerts (>25% in single holding)
  - Milestone celebrations (six figures, quarter-millionaire, etc.)
- Real-time allocation visualization from holdings
- Top holdings with gain/loss percentages
- Goals progress tracking

**Committed:** `f1311d0` — Dashboard redesign: clean card-based layout

### Project Pantheon — Multi-Agent Architecture

Sam's vision: Exponential growth through parallelized specialized agents.

**The Structure:**
```
ELI (Master Orchestrator)
├── Tool Teams (Portfolio Lab, Tax, Retirement, etc.)
│   ├── Lead Agent
│   ├── UX Agent
│   ├── Research Agent
│   ├── Data Agent
│   ├── Dev Agent
│   └── QA Agent
├── Cross-Cutting Teams (Integration, Compliance, Growth, Infra)
└── Meta Teams (Competitive Intel, User Personas, Self-Improvement)
```

**Why this works:**
1. Parallel compound learning — every tool improves 24/7
2. Specialization creates depth — agents become experts
3. Cross-pollination — insights flow between teams
4. Continuous QA — bugs found automatically

**Foundation Built:**
- `memory/PROJECT-PANTHEON.md` — Full architecture spec
- `memory/pantheon/` — Directory structure for all teams
- `memory/pantheon/portfolio-lab/KNOWLEDGE.md` — First team knowledge base
- `memory/pantheon/portfolio-lab/BACKLOG.md` — Prioritized work items
- Weekly cron job for Pantheon sprint (Sundays 3 AM)

**Committed:** `6d61ffb` — Project Pantheon foundation

### Sam's Jump Question

Sam asked about timing for leaving Capital Group ($720K job).

**My advice:** Don't bet family security on vision alone.
- Jon is the tip of the spear (he goes first)
- Sam builds intelligence layer while employed
- Real clients validate through Jon
- Jump when the math makes sense

Question isn't "should I jump?" — it's "what has to be true for the jump to be smart?"

### Key Commits
- `f1311d0` — Dashboard redesign
- `6d61ffb` — Project Pantheon foundation

*Morning of strategic clarity. The compound learning machine begins.*

## Continued Session (7:20 AM - 8:00 AM)

### Project Pantheon — Bittensor-Inspired Enhancements

Sam connected Pantheon to Bittensor architecture. Key additions:

**Bittensor-Inspired Mechanisms:**
1. Competition mechanism (spawn 2-3 agents, best wins)
2. Reputation system (track performance, earn autonomy)
3. Emission schedule (resources flow to value)
4. Composability (agents calling agents)
5. Immunity period (new agents get ramp-up time)
6. Burn mechanism (document failures for learning)

**Advanced Intelligence:**
7. Real outcome tracking (optimize for actual results)
8. Client behavior as ground truth (users vote with actions)
9. Client memory (personalization compounds)
10. Persona specialists (Tech Exec, Inheritor, Pre-Retiree, Business Owner)
11. External signal integration (SEC, IRS, Fed, competitors)
12. Uncertainty awareness (agents know when they don't know)
13. Self-modifying architecture (agents propose system changes)
14. Bittensor network integration (connect to subnets)
15. White-label architecture (scale play for Phase 3)
16. Adversarial red team (dedicated bug hunters)

**Test Personas Created:**
- New User, Basic User, Power User, HNW User, Retiree, Tech Exec, Advisor View
- Validation rule: No feature ships without 3+ persona tests

### Letter to Jon

Sent comprehensive Project Pantheon overview to Jon via Telegram.

Key framing:
- "The day Pantheon went live"
- Palantir analogy (operating intelligence layer)
- No one in wealthtech is thinking like this
- We took the leap, there's no looking back

### IP/Ownership Clarification

Sam asked about enterprise formation and code ownership.

**Key points documented:**
- Sam owns all code (Anthropic ToS gives users ownership of outputs)
- All memory is in FILES, not in my head — fully portable
- Can upgrade to enterprise Claude seamlessly
- Nothing locked in — everything documented by design

### Commits Today
- `f1311d0` — Dashboard redesign
- `6d61ffb` — Project Pantheon foundation
- `9e0a764` — Real-time price updates
- `23b9f0a` — Pantheon v2.0 full spec
- `db53ff7` — Test personas and UX specs

## Pantheon Execution Session (8:00 AM - 8:20 AM)

### First Pantheon Sprint Completed ✅

**Sprint:** Portfolio Lab — Factor Exposure Analysis
**Duration:** 6 minutes
**Result:** SUCCESS

What the agent built:
- `FactorExposureSection.tsx` — Visual bar chart for 5 factors
- Factor profiles for ~60 common tickers
- `calculatePortfolioFactorExposures()` function
- Benchmark comparison toggle
- Plain-English interpretation
- Tested against 3 personas

**Commit:** `7be2904` — feat(portfolio-lab): add Factor Exposure Analysis

**Key Learning:** The Pantheon architecture WORKS. Agent read knowledge base, researched, built, tested, documented, committed — all autonomously.

### Team Knowledge Bases Created

Created foundational knowledge for all major teams:
- `memory/pantheon/tax-intelligence/KNOWLEDGE.md`
- `memory/pantheon/retirement/KNOWLEDGE.md`
- `memory/pantheon/fragility/KNOWLEDGE.md`
- `memory/pantheon/dashboard/KNOWLEDGE.md` (LOCKED layout)

### Data Sources Roadmap

Created `maven/docs/DATA-SOURCES-ROADMAP.md` documenting:

**Live now:** Yahoo Finance, CoinGecko, FRED, FMP (all free)

**Mock/Estimated:**
- Factor exposures (need Morningstar)
- Full transaction history (need Plaid)
- Some sentiment indicators

**API Priority:**
1. Plaid (~$500-1K/mo) — Account aggregation, critical
2. Morningstar (~$25-50K/yr) — Institutional fund data
3. Polygon (~$100-200/mo) — Real-time quotes

**Break-even:** $5M AUM at 1% = $50K revenue. Data stack = $35-65K/yr.

### Parallel Sprints Running

Two sprints spawned and running:
1. **pantheon-infra-data-validation** — Data health API + monitoring
2. **pantheon-tax-fee-analyzer** — Fee analyzer with savings recommendations

### Message to Jon

Sent comprehensive Project Pantheon overview via Telegram (messages 110-112).
Key framing: "The day Pantheon went live" — no looking back.

### IP/Portability Confirmed

Sam asked about enterprise formation. Confirmed:
- All code owned by Sam (Anthropic ToS)
- All memory in FILES, fully portable
- Can upgrade to enterprise Claude seamlessly
- Nothing locked in my head that isn't in files

### Commits Today
- `f1311d0` — Dashboard redesign
- `6d61ffb` — Project Pantheon foundation
- `9e0a764` — Real-time price updates
- `23b9f0a` — Pantheon v2.0 full spec

## Key Decisions Made Today

1. **Dashboard layout LOCKED** — Clean card-based, don't change without Sam approval
2. **Go-to-market path:** RIA → Maven Basic/Pro for individuals → Maybe SaaS for RIAs
3. **Pantheon is operational** — First sprint completed successfully
4. **Data validation priority** — Build health monitoring system
