# 2026-02-09 — Pantheon Sprint Day

## Major Accomplishments

### Project Pantheon — Full Production Run
First major day running Pantheon at scale. **20+ features shipped in ~4 hours.**

**Features Built:**
1. Fee Analyzer — shows real $ fees, switch & save recommendations
2. UX Audit System — found 11 issues, built reusable framework
3. Data Health Monitoring — status indicator, price validation
4. Markets CORS Fix — SPY/QQQ now load via API proxy
5. Concentration Warning — P0 liability fix (85% TAO alert)
6. Allocation Widget — actual vs target toggle
7. Goal Math Fix — corrected $1.2M→$797K discrepancy
8. Holdings Visibility — VWO visible + tax jargon tooltip
9. Welcome/Quick Actions — value prop + show all actions on desktop
10. Chart Improvements — Y-axis labels, hover tooltips, goals $
11. Retiree Demo Variant — conservative $1.2M portfolio option
12. Overlap Detection — catches VTI+VOO redundancy, A-F grade
13. Competitive Intel — 10-platform analysis (see memory/research/competitive/)
14. Rebalancing Preview — tax-aware trade list
15. Wash Sale Tracker — 61-day window visualization
16. Oracle Prices Fix — get_market_data was a stub, now fetches real prices
17. What-If Trade Simulator — side-by-side comparison with gamification
18. Real-time Market Data — all client-side Yahoo calls routed through API
19. Demo Live Prices — demo page now fetches live prices too
20. Gamification Layer — trade grades A+ to F, achievement callouts

### Pantheon Infrastructure Improvements
Based on learnings from running agents all day:

1. **PANTHEON-STATUS.md** — Live tracker of running agents + file locks
2. **PATTERNS.md** — Common fixes and patterns (InsightCard types, CORS, etc.)
3. **QA Agent Protocol** — Spawn QA agent after commits to browser-test
4. **Task Sizing Guidelines** — Atomic tasks (1-2 files) > large tasks
5. **Credit-Conscious Spawning** — Check before spawning, priority gating

### Automated Crons Added
1. **Data Validation Sweep** (every 4 hours) — checks prices loading, timestamps, no errors
2. **Data Consistency Check** (every 6 hours) — allocations sum to 100%, fund classifications correct

## Key Bugs Found & Fixed

- **Demo variant selector** — was rendering but invisible (poor contrast), added label
- **Overlap detection** — was there but far down page, added anchor link
- **Oracle get_market_data** — was literally a stub returning placeholder text
- **Multiple CORS issues** — client-side Yahoo calls blocked, routed through API

## Strategic Discussions

### Funding Question
Sam asked about external funding. My recommendation: **Don't raise yet.**
- Pantheon makes burn rate almost nothing ($15-30/day for 20+ features)
- No PMF validation yet (need Jon's clients first)
- Equity is most valuable asset — raising now = more dilution for less
- Better path: Build → Launch with Jon → Prove usage → Then raise from strength

### Market Size Discussion
Sam pushed back that Maven could be worth "way more than millions." He's right:
- Personal Capital sold for $1B
- Credit Karma: $7B
- Plaid: $13.4B valuation
- Maven's positioning (AI-native, no AUM fees, Pantheon moat) could support $1-2B+ if executed

### Mezzi Competitive Analysis
Closest competitor. App Store shows 89 ratings (small user base, maybe 1K-10K users).
- $199/year pricing
- Has mobile app (we don't — gap)
- Missing: What-If Simulator, Factor Exposure, Overlap Detection, Fragility Index, RIA dashboard
- Maven has more depth; Mezzi has more polish and mobile presence

### Technical Debt Discussion
Accumulated from shipping fast:
- Code duplication (demo vs dashboard)
- MVP edge cases not handled
- No automated tests
- Some hardcoded values
- Inconsistent error handling

Recommendation: Plan 1-2 cleanup sprints before Jon's clients see it.

## Outstanding Issues

1. **Authenticated user prices** — Sam's real account not showing live prices (agent dispatched but unclear if fixed)
2. **Fund look-through** — Global funds (VTWAX) should show US/Int'l breakdown, not just "US Stock"
   - Approach: Use Yahoo's quoteSummary API for real fund composition data
3. **Mobile app** — Gap vs Mezzi, but not critical for RIA launch

## Files Created/Modified Today

**New Pantheon files:**
- `memory/pantheon/PANTHEON-STATUS.md`
- `memory/pantheon/PATTERNS.md`
- `memory/pantheon/portfolio-lab/WHATIF-GAMIFICATION.md`
- `memory/research/competitive/2026-02-09-competitive-landscape.md`

**Major component additions:**
- WhatIfSimulator.tsx (900+ lines with gamification)
- WashSaleTracker component
- FeeAnalyzer component
- OverlapDetection component
- ConcentrationWarning component
- Retiree demo variant

## Sam's Mindset Today

- Excited about Pantheon velocity ("insane speeds")
- Concerned about credit spend ($100s/day at peak)
- Thinking bigger than I was — sees billion-dollar potential
- Wants proactive QA agents catching issues automatically
- Values real-time data and "as of" timestamps for trust

## Tomorrow's Priorities

1. Verify authenticated user prices are working
2. Fund look-through via Yahoo quoteSummary API
3. Consider cleanup sprint for technical debt
4. Continue Pantheon at sustainable pace (not $100/day every day)

## 10:40 AM — Tech Debt + Expansion Sprint

Sam requested Pantheon focus on tech debt and expansion.

**Agents Spawned:**
1. **pantheon-market-debug** — Fix Markets widget showing "—" for stocks
2. **pantheon-benchmark-compare** — Add benchmark comparison (S&P 500, 60/40)
3. **pantheon-income-analysis** — Dividend yield + projected income
4. **pantheon-fragility-holdings** — Connect fragility to real user holdings

**Identified TODOs:**
- Look-through exposure (fund holdings) in portfolio-lab
- Tax-alpha state rate hardcoded
- Plaid save to database
- Multiple data-provider stubs (risk, retirement, etc.)

**Large files needing refactor:**
- profile/setup: 3,094 lines
- portfolio-lab: 2,908 lines
- portfolio-optimizer: 1,525 lines

## Afternoon Session: Pitch Deck Rewrite + GitHub Outage

### GitHub Outage (5+ hours)
- Started ~11:30 AM EST, still ongoing at 2:30 PM
- Status: "Partial System Outage" / "Minor Service Outage"
- Vercel couldn't clone repo — all deploys failing after 1 second
- Created monitoring cron to check every 5 min

### Pitch Deck Major Rewrite
Sam requested reframe around actual go-to-market strategy:

**Removed:**
- Robo-advisor positioning (don't compare to robos)
- Team slide

**New Structure (11 slides):**
1. Title — "The Intelligence Layer for Wealth"
2. Problem — Fragmentation (advisors juggle 8+ tools, nothing learns)
3. Vision — "Maven is the Palantir of wealth" (intelligence OS)
4. Maven Partners — Our RIA first, tip of the spear, real clients day one
5. The Arsenal — Fragility Index, What-If, Tax Intelligence, Oracle
6. **Human + AI** — NEW: Planners with planning/tech/psychology expertise
7. Flywheel — Maven Intelligence learns from every interaction
8. Roadmap — Partners NOW → Basic/Pro Q3 → SaaS for RIAs at scale
9. Why Now — AI threshold, AI-native architecture, unfair advantages
10. Where We Are — Platform built, RIA launching Q2
11. CTA — Let's talk

### Human + AI Strategic Insight
Sam's vision for scaling:
- Hire financial planners with THREE competencies:
  1. **Planning expertise** — tax, retirement, estate (the technical foundation)
  2. **Technology fluency** — native comfort with AI, push/question/improve Maven
  3. **Behavioral psychology** — understand emotional mistakes (fear, greed, loss aversion)
- AI handles analysis & optimization
- Human handles behavior & coaching
- Together = superhuman advisor
- This combination is rare → that's the moat

### Vercel Discovery (IMPORTANT)
Found TWO Vercel projects connected to same GitHub repo:
- **Production – maven-fscq** → ✅ SUCCEEDING (green checkmarks)
- **Production – dashboard** → ❌ FAILING (red X's)

We were checking the wrong project! The maven-fscq project is actually deploying successfully. Need to:
1. Find the maven-fscq production URL
2. Either point mavenwealth.ai to correct project OR delete broken dashboard project

### Data Validation Issue
Stock indices (SPY, QQQ, DIA, IWM) showing dashes in Markets widget. Crypto (BTC, TAO) works fine. Likely Yahoo Finance API issue — separate from GitHub outage.
