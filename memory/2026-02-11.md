# 2026-02-11 — Major Bug Bash + Feature Day

## Summary
Massive productivity day. Sam stress-tested Maven Partners and found 5 bugs — all fixed same session. Also built AI Meeting Prep feature and completed Bittensor integration research.

---

## Bugs Fixed (All Sam-reported)

1. **BTC Stale Price** — Hardcoded fallback prices were ancient. Updated to current values.

2. **Messages 404** — Client portal "Messages" link went nowhere. Created `/c/[code]/messages/page.tsx`.

3. **Partners Race Condition** — URL tracking with `useState` caused flicker/wrong state. Fixed with `usePathname()` hook.

4. **Demo Mode Not Preserved** — Internal links dropped `?demo=true`. Created `demoHref()` helper and applied throughout.

5. **Partners Bottom CTA Missing Demo** — "Get Started" button at bottom didn't preserve demo state. Added `?demo=true`.

---

## Features Built

### Explore Investments Page
- Client portal feature at `/c/[code]/explore`
- Search any ticker, get AI-powered analysis
- **Key design decision**: Disabled for anxious/retiree clients (toggleable per client via advisor settings)
- Framed as "research to discuss with your advisor" — not independent trading

### AI Meeting Prep
- Modal in advisor client detail page
- `/api/meeting-prep` endpoint calling Claude
- Generates: key topics, talking points, potential concerns, recommendations
- Currently uses static demo data with Claude integration ready
- Commit: `f9ad71f`

### Missing Pages Created
**Client Portal (4 pages):**
- `/c/[code]/estate` — Estate planning placeholder
- `/c/[code]/social-security` — SS optimization placeholder  
- `/c/[code]/tax` — Tax planning placeholder
- `/c/[code]/philanthropy` — Charitable giving placeholder

**Advisor Portal (7 pages):**
- `/partners/activity` — Recent activity feed
- `/partners/analysis` — Portfolio analysis tools
- `/partners/clients/new` — Add new client form
- `/partners/reports/new` — Generate report form
- `/partners/trades/new` — New trade form
- `/partners/meetings/new` — Schedule meeting form
- `/partners/alerts/new` — Create alert form

## Learnings Documented

Created `/memory/pantheon/LEARNINGS-2026-02-11.md` with 5 bug patterns:

- **L011**: Never ship a link without its destination page
- **L012**: ALL internal links must use `demoHref()` in demo-aware pages
- **L013**: Use `usePathname()` not `useState` for URL tracking (race conditions)
- **L014**: Search for placeholder/old brand names before release
- **L015**: Update hardcoded fallback data when market prices shift significantly

---

## Bittensor Research

### Integration Research Complete
Full report: `/memory/research/bittensor-integration-research.md`

**Chutes.ai** — Decentralized inference marketplace
- 85-95% cost reduction potential ($150/mo → $10-20/mo)
- OpenAI-compatible API
- DeepSeek R1, Llama 3.3, etc.
- **Blocked**: Needs Sam to run OAuth flow interactively

### Financial Subnets Found
1. **Taoshi Subnet 8 (PTN)** — Proprietary Trading Network
   - Aggregates trading signals from quant/DL systems
   - 60-day challenge format
   - $30M+ rewards pool
   - Could provide alpha signals for Maven

2. **Vanta** — AI/ML for financial market data
   - Trading insights
   - Market predictions
   - Needs deeper research

---

## Branding Fix
Changed "Adams Wealth" → "Maven Partners" throughout the advisor dashboard. Placeholder names shouldn't ship.

---

## Key Commits
- `68e4585` — Messages page
- `0cc433f` — Partners race condition fix
- `3266619` — Demo mode demoHref() helper

## Context for Tomorrow

### Blocked
- Chutes setup needs: `openclaw models auth login --provider chutes`
- Sam needs to run this interactively

### Next Steps
1. Complete Taoshi/Vanta deep dive
2. Sam runs Chutes OAuth
3. Quality A/B test: Claude vs Chutes
4. Prep for Altruist call (week of 2026-02-17)

### Altruist Context
- They launched AI tax planning 2026-02-10 (caused wealth stock selloff)
- Sam has intro call with custody team
- Position Maven as AI-native partner, not just custody customer

## QA Status
All 16 production routes returning 200 as of 12:00 EST.
Updated QA-CHECKLIST.md with today's bug patterns.

## Redis Setup (Late Night)

**Mission:** Set up persistent caching for Athena and market data.

**Completed via OpenClaw Browser Control:**
1. Navigated to Vercel Storage → Redis marketplace
2. Created free-tier Redis database: `redis-teal-village` (30MB)
3. Connected to `dashboard` project (all environments: Dev, Preview, Prod)
4. Region: Washington, D.C. (iad1) — close to users

**Code Changes:**
- Updated `cache.ts` to support both Upstash and standard Redis
- Checks `REDIS_URL` or `STORAGE_URL` env vars
- Falls back gracefully to in-memory when not configured
- Added `redis` npm package for TCP connections
- Updated health endpoint to report `upstash`/`redis`/`memory` types

**Commit:** `8475c90`

**Why This Matters:**
- In-memory cache lost on cold starts (serverless problem)
- Market data freshness is critical (L016 learning)
- Athena needs persistent query routing cache
- Health endpoint can now properly monitor cache status

---

## Build Failures (Late Night)

**Status:** 7 consecutive Vercel build failures blocking deployment.

**Production stuck on:** commit `44d961c` "fix: Add ALL missing advisor routes" (5+ hours old)

**Failed commits not yet deployed:**
- `35f156f` — Type fix (removed `shortName` from market-data response)
- `8475c90` — Redis integration

**L016 Bug (Stale Data):**
Sam caught stale market data again. Added proper data freshness checks:
- Data MUST be <1 hour old
- Updated `/api/market-data` with live/cached timestamps
- Updated fallback prices to current values
- Health endpoint now monitors freshness

**Market Data Label Fix:**
Changed "S&P 500" → "SPY" — showing actual ticker, not the index name, when displaying ETF price data.

**Athena Phase 1 Complete:**
~3,400 lines of core infrastructure:
- `synthesis.ts` — Signal normalization + weighted consensus
- `types.ts` — Full type system for hybrid AI
- `router.ts` — Query classification + provider routing
- `config.ts` — Provider costs, capabilities, weights
- Mock providers + test suite

**Next Session Priority:**
1. Check Vercel build logs to identify failure cause
2. Fix build errors
3. Verify Redis connection works in production
4. Continue Athena Phase 2 (Chutes integration)

---

## Chutes Integration Complete (Evening)

**Major Progress:**
1. **Chutes API Key Validated** — `cpk_7e97fa7edc3f4388b17cde8f7d92f579...`
2. **Provider Built:** `lib/athena/providers/chutes.ts` with OpenAI-compatible client
3. **Provider Index:** `lib/athena/providers/index.ts` for clean exports
4. **Test Endpoint:** `/api/athena/test/route.ts` for validation
5. **Committed:** `8893688` "feat(athena): Add Chutes decentralized LLM provider"

**Model Presets:**
- `cheap`: Mistral Small 3.1 24B — $0.02/M tokens
- `balanced`: DeepSeek R1 — $0.03/M tokens  
- `quality`: DeepSeek V3.2 — $0.25/M tokens
- `reasoning`: Qwen3 235B A22B — $0.08/M tokens

**TAO Funding:**
- Sam sent $100 TAO to Chutes wallet: `5FH336KRsbFfoY7dHbbWM7qyfHY4RoBhvyBuvsj9f4LPyLCz`
- Converts to USD balance instantly (prepaid credits)
- Waiting for blockchain confirmation (~2-5 min typical)

**Pending:**
- Add `CHUTES_API_KEY` to Vercel (browser open on dashboard)
- Test live at `https://mavenwealth.ai/api/athena/test` once funded

**Bug Found:**
Dashboard allocation chart sums to 101% instead of 100% (floating point rounding issue). Portfolio Lab shows ~100% correctly.

---

## Health Check Working

```
Redis: OK (2ms)
SPY: $691.96
BTC: $67,882
TAO: $148.47
```

All systems operational. Redis persistent cache is live.

## Athena → Oracle Integration Complete (Evening)

**Commits:**
- `3912551` — Fix 101% allocation bug (largest remainder method)
- `4f528eb` — Athena A/B test integration into Oracle

**What's Built:**
1. **oracle-bridge.ts** — A/B testing framework between Claude and Athena
2. **Chat API integration** — Routes queries through Athena when enabled
3. **Feature flags:**
   - `ATHENA_ENABLED` — Master switch
   - `ATHENA_AB_PERCENT` — Gradual rollout (0-100)

**Tested & Working:**
```
Query: "Should I rebalance my portfolio if I'm 15% overweight in tech?"
Classification: portfolio_analysis
Routing: cost path → Chutes (DeepSeek R1)
Cost: $0.0001 (vs ~$0.03 Claude = 99.7% savings)
Latency: 9.2 seconds
Response: Intelligent financial reasoning ✓
```

**A/B Test Flow:**
1. Query arrives
2. `shouldUseAthena()` checks: enabled? configured? A/B bucket?
3. If Athena: classify → route → Chutes query → return
4. If Claude: existing Oracle flow (tools, full context)
5. Fall back to Claude if Athena fails

**Next Steps:**
1. Enable Athena in production: `ATHENA_ENABLED=true`
2. Start at 10% A/B test: `ATHENA_AB_PERCENT=10`
3. Monitor metrics (latency, cost, quality)
4. Strip `<think>` tags from DeepSeek responses for cleaner UI
5. Add Groq for real-time queries (speed path)
