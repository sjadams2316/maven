# 2026-02-13 — Daily Notes

## Morning Session

### Pantheon Bug Investigation
- Sam asked about bugs found during "Project Pantheon" at 9pm (Feb 12)
- Searched memory: Feb 12 notes showed evening session activities (DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, Founder Architecture Refactor, Oracle personality updates) but no specific "Pantheon unleashed" record
- Sam clarified: "Remember I said to fix portfolio lab bug as an example. And then I mentioned to fix all other bugs as well."

### Portfolio Lab Demo Bug — FIXED ✅
**Bug:** Demo users saw $0 in Portfolio Lab instead of $800K sample portfolio

**Root Cause:** `/api/user/profile` requires Clerk auth; demo users (cookie auth only) get 401 → no holdings data

**Fix Applied:** Updated `/api/user/profile/route.ts`:
- GET: Returns `DEMO_PROFILE` if demo mode enabled
- POST: Returns 403 (demo mode is read-only)

**Files Modified:**
- `maven/apps/dashboard/src/app/api/user/profile/route.ts`
- `memory/pantheon/bugs/2026-02-12-portfolio-lab-demo-bug.md` (status updated to FIXED)

**Verification Needed:** Deploy to Vercel, test demo flow

### Overnight Cron Jobs
- Market Data Cache Warmer: Running every 5 minutes, all assets cached
- Maven Daily Research: Completed Fixed Income + Estate Planning deep dives (~35KB of docs)
- System Health Checks: Running at 4:02, 5:02, 5:32 AM EST

## Research Completed (Overnight)
- **Fixed Income Deep Dive:** Tax-efficient bonds, muni vs Treasury, bond ladders
- **Estate & Gift Basics:** 2026 exemption ($15M lifetime, $19K annual), state estate taxes
- **Key Alpha:** 4% CA muni = 8.18% taxable yield for 37% bracket; OBBGA made $15M exemption permanent

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Deploy Portfolio Lab fix to Vercel
- [ ] Verify demo mode works end-to-end
- [ ] Investigate other bugs from Feb 12 Pantheon session (if any exist)
