## The Brutal Truth

**The features you want (look-through, expense ratios, ETF holdings) require the Ultimate tier at $149/mo — NOT the $29/mo tier I mentioned earlier.**

I was wrong about the pricing. The cheaper tiers don't include ETF holdings.

|---------|-----------------|---------------|------|
| More API calls | Production reliability | Starter | $22/mo |

| **ETF holdings** | **Look-through exposure** | **Ultimate** | **$149/mo** |

| 13F holdings | Institutional tracking | Ultimate | $149/mo |

## My Honest Opinion

### Is FMP Ultimate ($149/mo) worth it?

**For where Maven is today: No.**

$149/mo = $1,788/year is significant for a product still in development. You'd be paying for features before you have users who need them.

**When it WOULD be worth it:**
- When you have paying users or institutional interest
- When look-through exposure is a key differentiator you're marketing
- When you're ready to build the "fund replacement recommendation" engine

### What I'd recommend instead:

**Phase 1 (Now):** Stay on free tier
- We already have: analyst ratings, financials, fundamentals
- Polygon handles crypto (your TAO works!)
- Build the product, get users

**Phase 2 (When needed):** Upgrade to Starter ($22/mo)
- More API calls for production load
- Real-time quotes
- Still no ETF holdings, but you may not need them yet

**Phase 3 (With traction):** Evaluate Ultimate vs Morningstar
- If you have institutional backing or revenue, $149/mo is trivial
- At that point, Morningstar direct API may also be accessible

---

## The Morningstar Question

You're right that Morningstar direct API requires enterprise backing. Their pricing is typically:
- $500-2,000+/mo for commercial use
- Requires business justification / use case review
- Best fund/ETF data in the industry

**But here's the thing:** If you have Capital Group or RIA backing for Maven, Morningstar becomes accessible. The same backing that would justify Morningstar would also make FMP Ultimate's $149/mo a rounding error.

---

## Bottom Line

**Don't pay $149/mo now.** Build with what you have (it's already impressive), get users, prove the concept. When you have traction, the data costs become justified and potentially fundable.

The look-through feature is cool but not essential for MVP. Users care about "what's my TAO worth?" (solved) before they care about "what's my indirect Apple exposure through ETFs?" (nice to have).
