# Maven: The Future of Wealth Management

**A Vision Document**  
*February 2026*

## The Problem Nobody Has Solved

There are 130 million American households. Most of them are navigating their financial lives alone.

**The wealthy** have family offices — teams of experts who know their complete financial picture, anticipate their needs, and optimize every decision.

**Everyone else** gets:
- Robos that treat them like a risk score
- Advisors who see them twice a year
- Apps that show numbers without meaning
- Complexity without clarity

The mass-affluent ($100K - $5M in assets) are the most underserved. Too complex for robos. Too small for traditional advisors to serve profitably. Left to figure it out themselves.

**This is the gap Maven fills.**

## What Maven Is

Maven is the first AI-native wealth intelligence platform — designed to give every family the experience that only the ultra-wealthy have today.

Not a robo-advisor. Not a dashboard. Not another app.

**Maven is a financial partner that thinks.**

It sees your complete picture — every account, every asset, every goal. It understands context — your age, your family, your fears, your dreams. It anticipates needs before you ask. And it explains everything in plain English.

### The Core Experience

**Oracle** — Your AI wealth advisor  
Ask anything. "Can I afford to retire at 58?" "What happens if the market drops 30%?" "Should I do a Roth conversion this year?" Get real answers, personalized to your situation, in seconds.

**Portfolio Lab** — Institutional-grade analysis  
See your portfolio the way professionals do. Stress test against historical crashes. Identify hidden risks. Get specific recommendations with clear explanations of *why*.

**Fragility Index™** — Market intelligence  
Our proprietary indicator measuring market stability across 8 dimensions and 40+ economic signals. Know when conditions are fragile — before the crowd does.

**Financial Snapshot** — Your future, visualized  
Interactive projections that respond in real-time. Adjust retirement age, savings rate, market assumptions — see the impact instantly. Plan with confidence.

## The Advisor Model

Here's what most people miss: **the best advisors aren't going away. They're being held back.**

Top advisors spend 70% of their time on tasks AI can do better:
- Pulling reports
- Preparing for meetings
- Answering routine questions
- Generating paperwork
- Monitoring portfolios for issues

That leaves 30% for what humans do best:
- Building trust
- Navigating emotions
- Making judgment calls
- Being present in crucial moments

**Maven flips this ratio.**

With Maven, advisors spend 70% of their time on high-value human connection. The platform handles the rest — not as a replacement, but as an amplifier.

### What This Means for Clients

- **24/7 access** to intelligent answers (not chatbot scripts)
- **Proactive communication** when it matters (not quarterly statements)
- **Complete transparency** into their financial lives
- **An advisor who knows them deeply** (because Maven handles the data)

### What This Means for Advisors

- **Serve more clients** without sacrificing quality
- **Deeper relationships** because prep is automated
- **Differentiated offering** that no wirehouse can match
- **Higher retention** because clients love the experience

---

## Why Now

Three forces are converging:

### 1. AI Has Crossed the Threshold
Large language models can now understand financial complexity, explain concepts clearly, and reason about tradeoffs. This wasn't possible 24 months ago.

### 2. Advisors Are Ready to Break Free
Record numbers of advisors are leaving wirehouses. They want independence, better economics, and technology that actually helps. The infrastructure to support them exists (custodians, TAMPs, compliance platforms). What's missing is the client experience that makes the leap worthwhile.

### 3. Clients Expect More
People manage their entire lives from their phones. They have real-time everything — except their finances. A PDF statement every quarter feels like a fax machine. They're ready for something better.

## The Business

### Phase 1: Maven-Powered RIA

Launch an independent RIA built on Maven from day one. Prove the model with real clients and real assets.

**Target:** $50-150M AUM initial book  
**Custody:** Schwab Advisor Services  
**Compliance:** Turnkey RIA infrastructure (RIA in a Box / NRS)  
**Revenue:** Standard AUM fees (competitive with wirehouses, better service)

This phase proves:
- Clients love the experience
- Advisors are more effective
- The technology works at scale
- Compliance is manageable

### Phase 2: Maven Pro (Advisor Platform)

License Maven to other independent advisors and RIAs.

**Model:** SaaS + AUM-based pricing  
**Target:** Breakaway advisors seeking differentiation  
**Distribution:** RIA networks, custodian partnerships, conferences

The first Maven-powered RIA becomes the case study. "Here's what our clients experience. Here's our retention rate. Here's our efficiency gain."

### Phase 3: Maven for Everyone

Once proven with advisors, expand to direct-to-consumer for the mass market.

**Model:** Freemium → subscription → premium  
**Target:** Mass-affluent DIY investors  
**Moat:** Years of advisor-refined AI, proven methodology, trusted brand

## What Makes This Different

### vs. Robos (Betterment, Wealthfront)
They optimize portfolios. We optimize financial lives. They're algorithms. We're intelligence. They replaced advisors. We amplify them.

### vs. Traditional Advisors
They see clients twice a year. We're always on. They pull reports manually. We surface insights automatically. They guess at held-away assets. We see everything.

### vs. Aggregators (Mint, Personal Capital)
They show data. We interpret it. They're passive dashboards. We're active partners. They died (Mint) or sold (Personal Capital). We're building a real business model.

### vs. Planning Software (eMoney, MoneyGuidePro)
They're tools advisors use. We're experiences clients love. They require training. We're intuitive. They generate reports. We have conversations.

## The Ask

We're not looking for passive investors. We're looking for partners who:

- **Believe** the wealth management industry is ready for disruption
- **Understand** that AI + human expertise beats either alone
- **Can help** with regulatory navigation, advisor recruitment, or strategic partnerships
- **Want to build** something that matters

If this resonates, let's talk.

## The Vision

Ten years from now, the idea that financial advice was only available to the wealthy will seem as outdated as the idea that information was only available in libraries.

Maven is how we get there.

Every family deserves a financial partner who knows them, anticipates their needs, and helps them build the life they want.

**We're building that partner.**
