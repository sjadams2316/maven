## Regional Research

### US Equities
**Last Updated: Feb 2026**

**Bull Case:**
- AI productivity revolution is real — enterprise adoption accelerating
- Earnings quality superior to other regions
- Corporate balance sheets strong
- Innovation ecosystem unmatched

**Bear Case:**
- CAPE at 32x historically leads to poor 10-year returns
- Mag 7 concentration (30% of S&P) is extreme
- Margin expansion exhausted, need revenue growth
- Higher rates = lower multiples

**Our View:** Neutral. Don't overweight at these valuations, but don't abandon the best market in the world. Tilt to equal-weight or value within US.

**Key Data Points:**
- S&P 500 earnings grew 8% in 2025 (AI-driven)
- Forward P/E: 21x (expensive but supported)
- Buyback yield: ~2% (supportive)

---

### International Developed
**Last Updated: Feb 2026**

**Bull Case:**
- 50% discount to US is historically extreme
- Dollar peaked (DXY down from 107 to 102)
- Japan corporate governance reforms working
- Europe energy crisis resolved
- Defense spending boost (NATO 2%+)

**Bear Case:**
- Demographics terrible (Japan, Europe aging)
- Growth potential lower than US
- Political instability (France, Germany)
- Value trap for 10+ years

**Our View:** Overweight. Valuations are compelling. But don't bet the farm — timing is impossible.

**Key Data Points:**
- MSCI EAFE P/E: 13x (cheap)
- Japan earnings growth: 12% (accelerating)
- European banks finally profitable
- Dividend yield: 3.2% (cash while you wait)

**The Int'l Question:** 
Sam correctly noted that people have been recommending international since 2015. Here's the nuance:
- 2015: Int'l was 20% cheaper than US
- 2020: Int'l was 30% cheaper than US
- 2026: Int'l is 50% cheaper than US
The gap has WIDENED, not closed. Eventually, mean reversion happens — but "eventually" can be 5-10 years.

### Emerging Markets
**Last Updated: Feb 2026**

**Bull Case:**
- Valuations dirt cheap (11x P/E)
- India structural growth story
- TSMC dominance in semiconductors
- Commodity supercycle (if it happens)

**Bear Case:**
- China weight (25%) is a liability
- Property crisis unresolved
- Geopolitical risk (Taiwan)
- Currency vulnerability

**Our View:** Neutral with caveats. Consider EM ex-China or India-specific exposure.

**Key Data Points:**
- India GDP growth: 7%+ (fastest major economy)
- China property: still dragging
- TSMC earnings: +30% (AI demand)
- EM flows: still negative (unloved)

---

### Fixed Income
**Last Updated: Feb 2026**

**Bull Case:**
- 4.5% yields are real income finally
- Inflation normalizing = Fed done hiking
- Recession hedge if economy weakens
- Real yields positive (+2%)

**Bear Case:**
- Fiscal deficits = supply flood
- Sticky inflation risk
- Duration risk if rates rise
- 2022 correlation breakdown (stocks & bonds fell together)

**Our View:** Neutral, finally investable. Bonds are "back" after the 2022 reset.

**Key Data Points:**
- 10Y Treasury: 4.3%
- Real yield: 2.0% (attractive)
- 30Y mortgage: ~6.5%
- Corporate yields: 5.5% (IG)

## Thematic Research

### AI Infrastructure
**Relevance: CIFR, IREN, TAO**

The AI compute buildout is real:
- Hyperscaler capex: $200B+ in 2025-2026
- Power demand for data centers: 2x by 2028
- GPU shortage continues (NVDA can't keep up)

**Bitcoin miners pivoting to AI:**
- CIFR, IREN, RIOT have power infrastructure
- Pivoting to AI compute hosting
- Higher margin than BTC mining
- Sam's thesis: early innings of compute infrastructure

**TAO/Bittensor:**
- Decentralized AI network
- 32 subnets running different AI tasks
- Token incentivizes compute contribution
- Bull case: Becomes the "AWS of AI"
- Bear case: Centralized AI wins (OpenAI, Anthropic)

---

### Dollar & Currency
**Last Updated: Feb 2026**

Dollar peaked in late 2024 at DXY 107. Now ~102.

**Why it matters:**
- Weak dollar = int'l stocks rally (for US investors)
- Strong dollar = EM pain
- Currency is ~50% of int'l returns short-term

**Our View:** Dollar likely to weaken as:
- Rate differential narrows
- US fiscal situation worsens
- Other economies stabilize

But don't hedge — currency volatility is part of int'l diversification.

## Capital Market Assumptions (CMAs)

### Vanguard (Dec 2025)
| Asset Class | 10-Year Return | Volatility |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| US Equities | 4.2-6.2% | 17% |
| Int'l Developed | 6.4-8.4% | 19% |
| Emerging Markets | 5.5-7.5% | 25% |
| US Aggregate Bonds | 4.3-5.3% | 5% |
| TIPS | 4.0-5.0% | 5% |

### BlackRock (2025)
| Asset Class | Expected Return |
|-------------|-----------------|
| US Large Cap | 6.2% |
| Int'l Developed | 7.1% |
| EM | 7.4% |
| US Agg | 4.8% |
| High Yield | 5.8% |

### Key Insight from CMAs
**Everyone expects non-US to outperform US over the next decade.** But they've been saying this for years. The question is: has the gap widened enough that mean reversion is imminent?

Our take: Possibly. The 50% valuation discount is historically extreme. But timing is impossible.

## Research Watchlist

Things we're monitoring:

1. **Japan reforms**: Are corporate governance changes sticking?
2. **China stimulus**: Will they backstop property?
3. **Dollar**: Watching DXY for trend change
4. **Credit spreads**: Early warning of stress
5. **AI adoption**: Enterprise spend on AI infrastructure
6. **TAO ecosystem**: Subnet growth, emissions schedule

## Historical Lessons

### The Int'l "Value Trap" (2010-2024)
- 2010: "International cheap, buy!"
- 2015: "Still cheap, stay the course!"
- 2020: "Even cheaper, great opportunity!"
- 2024: "Maybe this time...?"
- 2025: Finally starting to work

**Lesson:** Being right on valuation doesn't mean being right on timing. Diversify, but don't overweight just because something is "cheap."

### The Bond Bear Market (2020-2023)
- 2020: "Bonds yield 1%, no value"
- 2021: "Inflation transitory, stay long"
- 2022: Bonds -13% (worst ever)
- 2023: More pain
- 2024-25: Finally reset, 4.5% yields

**Lesson:** Starting yield determines bond returns. Low yields = low returns + high risk.
