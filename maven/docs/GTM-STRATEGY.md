# Maven Go-To-Market Strategy

## The Sequence (Not Parallel — Sequential)

Most startups try to do everything at once. We're being smarter.

---

## Phase 1: Captive Launch (Q2 2026)

### Setup
- **Jon registers as independent RIA** (or joins existing RIA structure)
- **Custody with Schwab** — industry standard, trusted, API-ready
- **Maven Partners only** — no public launch yet

### What This Looks Like
- Jon's existing relationships become first clients
- Each client gets Maven access through **advisor-curated dashboard**
- Jon controls what they see, how it's presented
- Clients experience the "family office feel"

### Why This First
1. **Real feedback** — Actual clients, real money, genuine reactions
2. **Case studies** — "Client X saved $12K in taxes using Maven"
3. **Word of mouth** — Clients tell friends, "my advisor has this incredible tool"
4. **De-risked** — We're not asking strangers to trust us
5. **Iterate fast** — Small user base, can change things weekly

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Schwab Advisor Services integration
- [ ] Account aggregation (Plaid)
- [ ] Advisor dashboard (✅ already built)
- [ ] Client portal with curated views
- [ ] Compliance workflows

---

## Phase 2: Word of Mouth (Q3-Q4 2026)

### Let It Spread Organically
- Don't launch publicly yet
- Let Jon's clients talk
- Let other advisors ask "what are you using?"
- Build waitlist of interested RIAs

### Soft Launch Maven Basic
- Simple landing page
- "Join waitlist" for full access
- Basic portfolio tracking (manual entry)
- Taste of what Maven can do
- **Purpose:** Capture leads, build email list

### Metrics to Watch
- Client satisfaction scores
- Referrals from existing clients
- Inbound inquiries from other advisors
- Waitlist signups

---

## Phase 3: Public Launch (Early 2027)

### Maven Basic (Free)
- Full public launch
- Manual data entry
- Basic AI interactions
- Market data, Fragility Index
- Educational content
- **Goal:** Top of funnel, lead generation

### Maven Pro ($29-49/month)
- Plaid account linking
- Unlimited Oracle AI
- Full tool suite
- Tax optimization, Monte Carlo, etc.
- **Goal:** Revenue + conversion funnel

### The E*Trade Flywheel Kicks In
```
Maven Basic (free users)
    ↓ some upgrade to
Maven Pro (paying users)
    ↓ life event (inheritance, retirement, baby)
    ↓ "I want professional help"
Maven Partners (AUM clients)
    ↓ great experience
    ↓ refers friends to their advisor
Maven Partners grows
    ↓ also refers friends to Maven Basic
Flywheel accelerates
```

---

## Phase 4: RIA SaaS (2027+)

### Once Proven
- Other RIAs have been asking since Phase 2
- We have case studies, testimonials, data
- Compliance workflows battle-tested
- Integration patterns documented

### Maven for Advisors (SaaS)
- White-label option
- Per-seat or AUM-based pricing
- Onboarding + training
- **This becomes the scale play**

---

## Why This Sequence Works

### 1. De-Risked Validation
We're not guessing what advisors want. Jon IS an advisor. His clients ARE real clients. We build what works.

### 2. Word of Mouth > Marketing
A client telling their friend "my advisor uses this incredible AI tool" is worth 100x a Facebook ad.

### 3. Flywheel Before Scale
The E*Trade model only works if Pro users actually WANT to become Partners clients. We prove that with Jon's clients first.

### 4. SaaS After Proof
Selling to other RIAs is easy when you can say:
- "Here's our AUM growth"
- "Here's our client satisfaction"
- "Here's the tax alpha we generated"
- "Here's the compliance audit we passed"

### 5. Capital Efficient
- Phase 1-2: Bootstrap with Jon's existing business
- Phase 3: Revenue from Pro subscriptions
- Phase 4: SaaS revenue scales

## Schwab Integration Details

### Why Schwab
- Industry standard for independent RIAs
- Trusted brand (clients feel safe)
- Robust API for account data
- Advisor Services support team
- No custody minimums for new RIAs

### What We Need
1. **Schwab Advisor Services account** — Jon applies
2. **API access** — Read-only for account data
3. **OAuth flow** — Clients authorize data access
4. **Real-time sync** — Positions, transactions, cash

### Alternative: Plaid for Everything
- If Schwab API is slow to get
- Plaid can aggregate Schwab accounts
- Slightly less real-time, but works
- Can run both in parallel

By the time competitors notice us:
1. **Data advantage** — Thousands of portfolios analyzed
2. **AI advantage** — Oracle trained on real conversations
3. **Trust advantage** — Proven with real money
4. **Distribution advantage** — Flywheel spinning
5. **Advisor network** — RIAs already using us
