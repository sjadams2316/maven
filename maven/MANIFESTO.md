# MAVEN MANIFESTO

*Version 2.0 — February 2026*

---

## The Problem is Fragmentation

Your financial life is scattered across a dozen accounts, three tax documents, two advisors, and a spreadsheet you update quarterly. No one sees the whole picture — not even you.

The wealthy solve this with family offices: dedicated teams that see everything, optimize everything, and act on everything. Everyone else gets:

- **Robos** that manage one account in a black box
- **Aggregators** that show balances but offer no intelligence  
- **Tax software** that shows up once a year to report what already happened
- **Advisors** that cost 1% annually and still miss opportunities

The system is designed for institutions, not individuals.

---

## The Vision: Your Financial Operating System

Maven is the **intelligence layer for your entire financial life**.

**See everything** — brokerage, 401k, crypto, real estate, tokenized assets — in one place.

**Understand what it means** — not just balances, but risks, opportunities, and tradeoffs explained clearly.

**Optimize continuously** — tax-loss harvesting, Roth conversions, asset location, capital gains timing — all year, not just at tax time.

**Execute seamlessly** — trade when you want to, or let Maven act on your behalf.

**File confidently** — when tax season comes, it's just formatting data we already have.

## The Six Gaps No One Fills

We researched every competitor. Here's what's missing:

| Gap | The Problem | Maven's Solution |
|-----|-------------|------------------|
| **Cross-account tax optimization** | Wealthfront only optimizes assets they hold | We see ALL your accounts, optimize across ALL of them |
| **Tax-aware trading** | You don't know the tax impact until after | We show you BEFORE you trade |
| **Year-round tax strategy** | TurboTax only shows up in April | We optimize January through December |
| **Consumer Roth/asset location** | Requires $500K+ and an advisor | We democratize it with AI |
| **The full loop** | No one does Aggregate → Analyze → Optimize → Trade → File | We do all five |
| **AI-native architecture** | Others add AI as a feature | We build FROM AI |

---

## The Tokenization Thesis

By 2030, the tokenized asset market will grow from ~$50B to $2-30 trillion.

Your portfolio in 2029 won't just be stocks and bonds. It'll include:

- **Tokenized real estate** — Fractional ownership of properties worldwide
- **Tokenized treasuries** — T-bills on-chain, earning yield 24/7
- **Tokenized private equity** — Access to Apollo, KKR, Blackstone deals
- **Crypto-native assets** — BTC, ETH, TAO
- **AI-generated alpha** — Signals from decentralized intelligence networks like Bittensor

**The problem no one is solving:**

Current platforms can't handle the tax complexity of tokenized assets — cross-chain movements, RWA income distributions, fractional real estate depreciation. They're blind to it.

**Maven's opportunity:**

We're building the aggregator for this future NOW — before the market consolidates. The window is 2026-2027. First mover wins.

## What Makes Maven Different

| Everyone Else | Maven |
|---------------|-------|
| Manages OR tracks OR plans | Does all three |
| Works with accounts they hold | Works with ALL your accounts |
| Black box decisions | Transparent reasoning |
| AI-assisted | AI-native |
| Reactive (reports the past) | Proactive (optimizes the future) |
| Sees dollars only | Sees dollars AND tokens |
| Traditional assets | Traditional + tokenized + crypto |
| Seasonal tax help | Year-round tax intelligence |

---

## The Three Promises

### 1. Clarity
You will always understand your complete financial picture and what it means.

No black boxes. No jargon. When Maven suggests something, it explains why — in plain language.

### 2. Optimization  
You will never leave money on the table through tax inefficiency, poor asset location, or missed opportunities.

The average investor loses 0.5-1% annually to poor tax management. Maven eliminates that.

### 3. Sovereignty
Your data is yours. Your decisions are yours. 

Maven serves you — we don't sell you, and we don't sell your data. We're not a funnel for advisors or a lead-gen machine. We make money when you get value.

## Who We're For

- People who want to **understand** their money, not just automate it
- People **underserved** by advisors who charge 1% for generic advice
- People building wealth across **traditional and emerging** asset classes
- People who believe finance should be **intelligent, transparent, and fair**

## The Revenue Model

| Service | Price | Comparable |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Free tier** | $0 | Aggregation + basic insights |
| **Maven Pro** | $20-50/mo | Full tax optimization, trading integration |
| **Tax Filing** | $50-150/yr | vs. TurboTax $89-219 |
| **Trading** | Free | Via Alpaca (revenue share) |
| **Maven Advisor** | $200-500/mo | For RIAs serving clients |

We make money when you get value. Not from selling your data. Not from pushing you to advisors.

---

## The End State

One place to:
- See every dollar and token you own
- Understand your risks and opportunities  
- Optimize your taxes continuously
- Trade any asset — traditional or tokenized
- File your taxes without touching another app
- Get intelligence that improves over time

**The family office for everyone.**

Not through cheap automation, but through genuine intelligence.

---

## Why Now

1. **AI is ready** — Large language models can finally reason about complex tax situations
2. **Tokenization is arriving** — BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton are all moving on-chain
3. **Regulation is clarifying** — SEC and DTCC guidance in 2025-2026 unlocks tokenized securities
4. **The incumbents are asleep** — TurboTax is seasonal, robos are siloed, aggregators are dumb
5. **The window is open** — 2026-2027 is the moment before consolidation

---

## The Competition Doesn't Get It

**TurboTax** sees you once a year. We see you every day.

**Wealthfront** optimizes one account. We optimize all of them.

**Empower** shows you balances. We show you what they mean.

**Mezzi** gives suggestions. We execute them.

**Everyone else** is adding AI. We're built from AI.

---

## Built By

**Sam Adams** — VP at Capital Group. Spent a decade watching institutional tools serve the wealthy while everyone else got table scraps.
