---

## 🟡 NEEDS ATTENTION

### 1. Onboarding Flow (/onboarding)
**Issue:** Progress isn't visually saved between steps
- User might not know their data is being captured
- Consider: Auto-save indicator ("Saved ✓") after each section

**Issue:** Holdings input can be tedious for many positions
- 45+ holdings would take 20+ minutes to enter manually
- Consider: CSV import or "paste from spreadsheet" option

### 2. Dashboard
**Issue:** "Let Maven Get to Know You" card shows even if partially complete
- Should show progress percentage or hide if mostly complete

**Issue:** Market data shows "Loading..." then "—" if API fails
- Should show cached data or "Market closed" message

### 3. Social Security Optimizer
**Issue:** No validation that benefit amounts are realistic
- User could enter $50,000/month benefit with no warning
- Consider: Range validation with soft warnings

**Issue:** Life expectancy slider lacks context for edge cases
- "100 years" might seem unrealistic
- Consider: Show actuarial context ("Top 5% live to 95+")

### 4. Mobile Responsiveness
**Issue:** Holdings table in onboarding cramped on mobile
- Columns overlap on small screens
- Consider: Card layout on mobile vs table on desktop

### 5. Oracle Chat
**Issue:** Chat history not persisted between sessions
- User loses conversation context on refresh
- Consider: Save recent messages to localStorage

## 🔴 BUGS FOUND

### 1. Crypto Holdings Classification
**Location:** Dashboard asset allocation
**Issue:** BTC, ETH, TAO in "investment accounts" may be categorized as "US Equity" instead of "Crypto"
**Impact:** Asset allocation chart shows wrong distribution
**Fix:** Check `categorizeWithProfiles()` function for crypto tickers

### 2. Cost Basis Display
**Location:** Holdings table
**Issue:** Holdings with 0 cost basis show "$0" instead of "—" or "Not provided"
**Impact:** Looks like a bug to users
**Fix:** Add conditional rendering for missing cost basis

### 3. Tax Alpha Scanner
**Location:** Dashboard Tax Alpha Counter
**Issue:** Scanner may flag positions in retirement accounts (which can't be harvested)
**Impact:** Misleading tax-loss opportunities shown
**Fix:** Verify `tax-loss-scanner.ts` filters by `accountGroup === 'taxable'`

### 4. Header Financial Summary
**Location:** Landing page header (when signed in)
**Issue:** Shows "$0" net worth briefly before data loads
**Impact:** Jarring visual flash
**Fix:** Show skeleton loader instead of $0
